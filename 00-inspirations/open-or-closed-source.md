# Open or Closed Source

Everything I do is open. Here is some of my thinking:

* At my age that last thing I need is people making demands of my remaining mortal coil minutes
* I have  fair amount of money. Goldilocks amount. Not too much, not too little. Just right.
* I may not have billions to throw around, but I have a fair amount of accumulated wisdom to share around

I do not want to be beholden to others.

At the same time, I want a wide possible audience, dissemination, people involved and use of my work.Linus Torvalds, Guido van Rossum, Kernighan & Ritchie, Bjarne Stroustrup, Alain Colmerauer & Robert Kowalski and others are heroes. They have created far more wealth and social capital than Steve and Bill. They have made the world a better place by **sharing** their work.

If I am in the very fortunate position of having the ability to share, then I am obligated to share.
