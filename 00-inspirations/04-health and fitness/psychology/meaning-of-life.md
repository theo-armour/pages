## Meaning of Life

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning\_of\_life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life)

Finding meaning in life is a very tricky thing indeed, Fortunately and similarly to confirmation, analysis and bar mitzvah - you can skip the whole thing and still have a perfectly decent life while completely ignoring the topic. Of course if you do a double-click into finding meaning, you will find “it’s turtles all the way down.”

For me it’s doing nice things - things that are simultaneously nice for me and good for the world.

I care therefore I am.
