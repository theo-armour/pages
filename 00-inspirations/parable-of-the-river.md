# The Parable of the River

Once, there was a man standing by a riverbank. Suddenly, he saw someone struggling in the water, clearly drowning. The man jumped in and pulled the person to safety.

No sooner had he caught his breath than another person came floating down the river, flailing and gasping for air. Again, the man leapt in and saved them.

This happened again and again-each time the man rescued someone, another would appear, swept along by the current, in desperate need of help.

Eventually, exhausted and bewildered, the man climbed out of the river and started walking upstream.

A bystander, who had been watching, called out, “Where are you going? There’s another person drowning! Why aren’t you saving them?”

The man replied, “I’m going upstream to find out why so many people are falling into the river. If I can stop the cause, I won’t have to keep pulling people out one by one.”

## The Lesson

This parable is often used to illustrate the difference between **reactive** and **proactive** problem-solving. While helping those in immediate danger is vital, it’s also crucial to address the root causes of problems to prevent them from happening in the first place.

Also symptoms and root causes.
