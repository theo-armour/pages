Um, I only watched the first minute or so. ;-(

I let Gemini 3 do the heavy listening.

And all of this is yet another indication of the future transition of culture from one of literacy to orality — as is currently happening  — and then on to a future of a mixture of both.

In literate cultures, what is written is remembered and and in some way lives.

In oral cultures, most everything is forgotten, almost immediately after the words are uttered.

At some time in the future, cultures will have both oral and literate aspects. Everything uttered can be remembered.

As is frequently so: a provocative read. Thank you.

Do you also see loss of community memory as part of a move from?

* Literacy to orality
* Blog post to podcast
* Email to SMS
* Forum to Discord
* And so on?

Perhaps even from other media such as from TV to TikTok or even from talking to tweeting emojis.

The move from orality to literacy was well covered by people such as

Are there any peeps out covering the return to orality? Yes, Cory Doctorow covers 'enshittification', but that not cover things like changes in generational worldviews or an alternative Eudaimonia. There probably are, but, OMG, that would probably entail having to watch thousands of TikToks.

Doh!

Of course we're moving to orality! We are increasingly verbalizing our thoughts.I'm using voice-to-text all over the place! Almost everything I type is using voice-to-text. Increasingly, I am wearing my smart glasses and talking to it using my voice.

At some time in the future, there will be devices that will be reading the thoughts in our brain, and it will be our internal voice talking to the chat bots Who will reply either directly to the brain or by speakers in the smart glasses

Here's my conjecture.

Currently, many people have an inner dialogue, a self-talk, an inner speech, a stream of consciousness way of thinking.

The conscious part has words, images, and things we can talk about. The subconscious part has who-knows-what popping in and out.

These days we're beginning to see devices that can speak the words and display the images of what is going on in our brains. As these devices progress, they will be able to read aspects of the subconscious mind.

In the future, the chatbots may become the digital twins of your subconscious. The chatbots will be able to verbalize and talk to your  conscious mind about what seems to be going on in the subconscious.
