As is frequently so: a provocative read. Thank you.

Do you also see loss of community memory as part of a move from?

* Literacy to orality
* Blog post to podcast
* Email to SMS
* Forum to Discord
* And so on?

Perhaps even from other media such as from TV to TikTok or even from talking to tweeting emojis.

The move from orality to literacy was well covered by people such as

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Ong#Orality_and_Literacy_(1982)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#The_Gutenberg_Galaxy_(1962)

Are there any peeps out covering the return to orality? Yes, Cory Doctorow covers 'enshittification', but that not cover things like changes in generational worldviews or an alternative Eudaimonia. There probably are, but, OMG, that would probably entail having to watch thousands of TikToks.
