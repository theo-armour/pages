# Communication ~ text messaging vs email vs GitHub

In my world, we have to share:

* Code
* Bug reports & issues
* Documentation
* Wishlists
* & much more

Test messaging is fine for scheduling and checking in, but text messaging is not a good way to share the type of information listed above. I might be able to text you each time there is an update, but that is not a good way to share information with a group of people. We need a better way to share this information.

Text is fine for messages up to ten to twenty words.

Email is fine for simple topics and messages up to a few paragraphs.

For anything larger or more complex, I use GitHub and VS Code for most of my efforts. And I am trying out Notion.so to communicate with my daughters.

How do you generally tackle these issues?
