A fundamental aspect of this project is to follow the Wikipedia Core Content Policies

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core\_content\_policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies)

* Neutral point of view – All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.
* Verifiability – Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source. In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that information comes from a reliable source.
* No original research – Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.

Wherever possible, the goals will link to reports, studies, laws, codes or whatever that support the premise at hand. It is intended that the work be evidence-based rather than thoughts off the top of people’s head.
