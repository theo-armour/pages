Our Father, who art in heaven, ~ I thought God was everywhere
hallowed be thy name; ~ why do we hallow just your name?
thy kingdom come, ~ we don't want democracy
thy will be done ~ we don't want our will done
on earth as it is in heaven. ~
Give us this day our daily bread, ~ a handout?
and forgive us our trespasses, ~
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Most Protestants conclude with the doxology:
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen. (or ...forever. Amen.)
