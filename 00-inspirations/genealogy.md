# Genealogy

## 2025-10-10 Why an interest in genealogy?

History tends to remember the lives of famous people. Perhaps half of them are remembered for having done evil and nasty things.

As far as I'm concerned, everybody has a right to be remembered. And the more you look into the lives of ordinary people, you will find that they are just as interesting as the famous ones.

I submit as evidence for this conjecture that the great works of fiction mostly describe the lives of ordinary people.

I further submit that genealogy is the first tool to use to investigate the possibility of interesting aspects of the lives of ordinary people.

Finally, I offer the conjecture that as we discovermore of these stories, we will come to the conclusion that the great majority of people that have ever lived have sought "preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
