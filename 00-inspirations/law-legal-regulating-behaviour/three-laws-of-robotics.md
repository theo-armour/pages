# Three Laws of Robotics

The Three Laws of Robotics are a set of rules devised by the science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "Runaround", although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws are:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

The laws are incorporated into almost all of Asimov's science fiction, and are the basis of the science fiction sub-genre of robot ethics. They are also incorporated into the real-world study of robot ethics.

The Three Laws, and the zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media. They have influenced the development of real-world robots, and are a topic of active research in the field of artificial intelligence.
