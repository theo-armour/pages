> The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The structure of Sustainable Development Goals.

## Topics

17 goals that are organized around the three interconnected pillars of sustainable development: social, economic, and environmental.

Grouping the indicators by topic

* People: This is the biggest indicator group, including 93 indicators (40.6% of the total). They relate to the status and wellbeing of human beings, for example unemployment rates.
* Money: This includes 60 indicators (26.2 % of the total), with most measurements given in US dollars. This group examines different types of monetary flows, for example government spending on poverty reduction programmes.
* Plans and policies: With 38 indicators, (about 16.7% of the total), this is the third group. The indicators examine how policies, regulations and laws are affecting the implementation and success of sustainable development goals. Examples include “Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex” (indicator 5.1.1)
* Production and consumption: Including 20 indicators (8.7% of the total), this group refers to indicators measuring the flow of material and energy in the global economy. It looks at aspects such as material footprint and modes of transport.
* Planet: This category consists of 18 indicators (7.9% of the total). They measure the earth’s physical systems, such as water levels, forest loss and agriculture.
