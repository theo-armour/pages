There’s a lot to be said for Diogenes, Gandhi and Thoreau. They espoused a simple life. They are not alone. Promoting aspects of the possibility of a simple lifestyle at the Heritage might serve as a market differentiator with competing institutions that tend to promote a replete lifestyle.

A rationale for becoming a resident at the HotM is that it may enable a lifestyle that is much simpler with little loss of benefits. It may enable a downshift lifestyle that increases pleasure.
