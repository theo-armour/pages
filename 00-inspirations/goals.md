## Goals Setting Criteria

Goal-setting criteria are used to guide the setting of effective goals. Common criteria include the SMART criteria, FAST goals, and OKR goals.

They may define frameworks for setting goals, or may be used to evaluate the quality of existing goals.

The SDGs "goals, targets, and indicators" are another example of goal-setting criteria.
