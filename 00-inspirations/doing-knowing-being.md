## Concept

My current major ontology/epistomology of life effort

* How look at something and make sense of it?
* How do you know what you know?
* How can you find it again?
* How can you compare whatever?

What I do - while trying to do some good:

* Stand on the shoulders of gianta. Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research
* Identify beauty. If beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, then help the eyes see things

More

* Neutral point of view
* Free content
* Respectful
* Experimental
* Cite verifiable sources

## Dining 3 things

* Management - hiring, ordering, contracting

## Critical Thinking

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking

Edward M. Glaser proposed that the ability to think critically involves three elements:[16]

* An attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences
* Knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning
* Some skill in applying those methods.
