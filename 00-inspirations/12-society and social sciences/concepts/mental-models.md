# Mental Models

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model#Characteristics

A mental model is generally:

* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts;
* flexible â€“ considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense;
* an information filter that causes selective perception, perception of only selected parts of information;
* very limited, compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a scientific model is extensive and in accordance with a certain reality in the derivation of logical consequences of it, it must take into account such restrictions as working memory; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, gestaltisms or failure of the principles of logic, etc.;
* dependent on sources of information, which one cannot find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.[5][6][7]

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".[8] Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

Prompt: Ruminate on the question of whether the concept of "mental models" are questions of philosophy or psychology.

My take: categorize in philosophy is better for my use case.

Prompt: Into what sub branches of psychology and philosophy, would you place the concept of metal models?

My take: philosophy: epistemology is the best fit for my use case.

Mental models fit in. Epistemology

Where? Applied Epistemology?
