# Law Legal Regulating Behavior

I heart plumb lines. Disclaimer: I was a registered architect for decades, ;-)

I am not the plumb line. Something else is. I only do the measuring and the marking.

In devising my plumb line, my first thought must be to "stand on the shoulders of giants". I must look to the great thinkers and the great doers who have come before me. I must look to the great thinkers and the great doers who are with me now.

I heart "giants". I collect them. Below I list a few of them.

In the past, for me, the Gospel has not been a plumb line. It will be interesting to see how this course causes me to change my thinking..

> The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

## Saint Paul’s School ~ The School Prayer

I recited the following prayer frequently during mu six years at Saint Paul's School. Many years later I was reminded of it. Now I can't forget it.

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."
