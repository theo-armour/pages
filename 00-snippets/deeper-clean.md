## For a deeper clean:

Here’s a simple cleaning solution you can make with household ingredients to deep clean your bottle or tumbler or tackle any hard-to-handle stains.

## What you need:

* Vinegar ~ "Amazon cleaning vinegar"
* Baking soda
* Water

## Here’s what to do:

Mix 1-part cleaning vinegar, 1-part water and 1 tablespoon baking soda inside your bottle or tumbler. Let sit overnight. The next day, pour out ¾ of the mixture and add another 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Scrub thoroughly with the Simple Modern brush, rinse, then set aside to air dry.
