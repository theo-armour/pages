## SMART

SMART Goal – Specific

SMART goals are:

* Specific: Well defined, clear, and unambiguous
* Measurable: With specific criteria that measure your progress towards the accomplishment of the goal
* Achievable: Attainable and not impossible to achieve
* Realistic: Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose
* Timely: With a clearly defined timeline, including a starting date and a target date.

Goals that are specific have a significantly greater chance of being accomplished. To make a goal specific, the five “W” questions must be considered:

* Who: Who is involved in this goal?
* What: What do I want to accomplish?
* Where: Where is this goal to be achieved?
* When: When do I want to achieve this goal?
* Why: Why do I want to achieve this goal?

## INVEST

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)

The INVEST mnemonic for Agile software development projects was created by Bill Wake[1] as a reminder of the characteristics of a good quality Product Backlog Item (commonly written in user story format, but not required to be) or PBI for short. Such PBIs may be used in a Scrum backlog, Kanban board or XP project.

Letter Meaning Description
I Independent The PBI should be self-contained.
N Negotiable PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.
V Valuable A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.
E Estimatable You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.
S Small PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize within a level of accuracy.
T Testable The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information t
o make test development possible.


## Patterns

### Issues / Problems

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.
