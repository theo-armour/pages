# Things I like


## Around my desk

### Giotto Rocket Air Blaster

Gets junk out of my keyboards, looks nice on my desk and feels nice to use

Is it as good as a vacuum cleaner? No. But I do not want to keep a vacuum on my desk.


## Living like a monk

The style of your room follows the style of the building.

As simple and as minimal as possible.

Everything has its place. And the place is visible.

Desk and bed are adjustable.

No wastebasket. Trash is taken out immediately.

Few drawers. Drawers are translucent so content type may be identified without opening the drawer

There is a visible place for things yet to be discarded.

Things are moved around and about.

The center line of your bed is parallel to the center line of the bath tub (or shower). From the Fert√©s.

Use the splashbacks and skirting boards to hold things.



## Peter Piper

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
A Peck of pickled peppers, Peter Piper picked.
but, if Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Where is the peck of pickled peppers? Peter Piper picked.


## You remind me of a man.

You remind me of a man.
What man?
A man with the power.
what power?
A man with the power of voodoo.
Who do?
You do.
Do what?
You remind me of a man.
