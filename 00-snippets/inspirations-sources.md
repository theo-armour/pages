## Basic Idea

[https://www.salon.com/2021/06/15/why-our-wandering-brains-are-wired-to-love-art-and-nature/](https://www.salon.com/2021/06/15/why-our-wandering-brains-are-wired-to-love-art-and-nature/)

But here is the takeaway: we are not biologically programmed to like or this or that object, but rather inclined to enjoy the process of play, improvisation, trial, and error in all things. In other words, recent research into mind wandering and fractals suggests that the process of creativity and unconscious play involved in making and experiencing art is a crucial source of aesthetic beauty and our love of nature.

## Abstraction

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction)

Abstraction is a conceptual process wherein general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal (real or concrete) signifiers, first principles, or other methods.

## Burning Man > The 10 Principles of Burning Man

> Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey wrote the 10 Principles in 2004 as guidelines for the newly-formed Regional Network. They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception.

## Effective Altruism or Radical Philanthropy

tags #virtue #ea #altruism #philanthropy

Category philosophy and thinking > virtue > altruism

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective\_altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)

Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that advocates using evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Altruism refers to improving the lives of others—as opposed to egoism, which emphasizes only self-interest. Effectiveness refers to doing the most good with whatever resources are available—as opposed to only doing some amount of good—as well as determining what is the most good by using evidence and reasoning—as opposed to only doing what feels good or appears intuitively appealing.

> William MacAskill’s movement set out to help the global poor. Now his followers fret about runaway A.I. Have they seen our threats clearly, or lost their way?  
> “The world’s long-run fate depends in part on the choices we make in our lifetimes,” the philosopher William MacAskill writes.

> "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" is an essay written by Peter Singer in 1971 and published in Philosophy and Public Affairs in 1972. It argues that affluent persons are morally obligated to donate far more resources to humanitarian causes than is considered normal in Western cultures. The essay was inspired by the starvation of Bangladesh Liberation War refugees, and uses their situation as an example, although Singer's argument is general in scope and not limited to the example of Bangladesh. The essay is anthologized widely as an example of Western ethical thinking.

## Happiness, Hedonism

Much of my behavior is determined by desires to increase pleasure and to decrease pain. I am a regular hedonist.

At the same time, I feel the need for meaning, purpose and being useful.

## Meaning of Life

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning\_of\_life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life)

Finding meaning in life is a very tricky thing indeed, Fortunately and similarly to confirmation, analysis and bar mitzvah - you can skip the whole thing and still have a perfectly decent life while completely ignoring the topic. Of course if you do a double-click into finding meaning, you will find “it’s turtles all the way down.”

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles\_all\_the\_way\_down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)

For me it’s doing nice things - things that are simultaneously nice for me and good for the world.

### Mission ~ What do you do

* Statements of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future
* Defines the fundamental purpose of an organization or an enterprise,
* Succinctly describes why the organization exists and what it does to achieve its vision.
* The mission is the means of successfully achieving the vision
* 2021-07-02 the mission statements respond to human needs

### Vision ~ Why do it

* A descriptive picture of a desired future state
* Outlines what the organization wants to be
* How it wants the world in which it operates to be (an "idealized" view of the world).
* A long-term view and concentrates on the future
* May be emotive and is a source of inspiration.

### Values ~ Who you are

* Statements of ethics, principles, beliefs that are shared among the stakeholders of an organization.
* Statements of values that drive an organization's culture and priorities and provide a framework in which decisions are made.
* How do you want to behave?

## Patterns ~ Problems ~ APL

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language](https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

* Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right
* if you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.

Theo: I am an atheist. I strip out all the god stuff here and keep the rest

> "Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."

## Separation of Concerns

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
> courage to change the things I can,

## Simple Living ~ Simplicity

There’s a lot to be said for Diogenes, Gandhi and Thoreau. They espoused a simple life. They are not alone. Promoting aspects of the possibility of a simple lifestyle at the Heritage might serve as a market differentiator with competing institutions that tend to promote a replete lifestyle.

A rationale for becoming a resident at the HotM is that it may enable a lifestyle that is much simpler with little loss of benefits. It may enable a downshift lifestyle that increases pleasure.

* Stand on the shoulders of giants. Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research

“Poor artists copy. Great artists steal.”

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements already written.

At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

A fundamental aspect of this project is to follow the Wikipedia Core Content Policies

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core\_content\_policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies)

* Neutral point of view – All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.
* Verifiability – Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source. In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that information comes from a reliable source.
* No original research – Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.

Wherever possible, the goals will link to reports, studies, laws, codes or whatever that support the premise at hand. It is intended that the work be evidence-based rather than thoughts off the top of people’s head.

## Fixing it may break it

Fixing something that is old does not make it new. If you do want something contemporary and futurable you may need to take the old bits and reimagine them into an entirely new thing.

Looking back at the way things were done in the past may not always help you create a good vision for the future.
