## Highlight colors

Yellow: Often used for important points, key concepts, or passages you want to revisit later. Yellow highlights stand out without being too distracting.

Blue: Consider using blue for definitions, vocabulary, or any text that requires clarification. Blue highlights can help you quickly identify terms youâ€™d like to explore further.

Pink: Pink highlights are great for personal reflections or emotional moments in the text. Use pink to mark sections that evoke feelings or memories.

Orange: highlights can represent quotes, inspirational lines, or passages that resonate with you. They add a touch of freshness to your reading experience.
