## Highlight colors

Yellow: Often used for important points, key concepts, or passages you want to revisit later. Yellow highlights stand out without being too distracting.

Blue: Consider using blue for definitions, vocabulary, or any text that requires clarification. Blue highlights can help you quickly identify terms you’d like to explore further.

Green: Green highlights can represent quotes, inspirational lines, or passages that resonate with you. They add a touch of freshness to your reading experience.

Pink: Pink highlights are great for personal reflections or emotional moments in the text. Use pink to mark sections that evoke feelings or memories.

Orange: Reserve orange for action items, to-do lists, or practical information. It’s a vibrant color that draws attention to actionable content.

Purple: Purple highlights can indicate character development, plot twists, or significant events in a story. It adds depth to your annotations
