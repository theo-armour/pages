## Downsizing

* Move first. Downsize second


## Mission

Reason for downsizing

* I will move to the Heritage with 100 things
* Clothes and computers will be existing, furniture new

Why

* To understand that you can live well without possessing
* To look tp the future not the past
* For fun

What happens

* In essence everything must go
* It's about recording the possession of things for posterity

## Values

* wait until the current purchase has arrived before you order something new. Wait until the current Buy has arrived before you order something else

## 100 things

    A cause for pause, The 100 Thing Challenge is a response to the culture of materialism in America, one that has filled our lives with the constant and unsatisfactory desire for more. Dave Bruno offers compelling anecdotes and practical advice to help readers live more meaningfully, simply by casting off the unnecessary stuff that clutters their lives. The 100 Thing Challenge is a golden opportunity to experience the positive changes that occur as you defiantly hop off the treadmill of consumerism.

## Vision

* It's an art project
* It's my afterlife
* It's a way of respecting the people of the past
* It's fodder for the historian of the future
* It's about preparing a guide book for others
* It simplifies the estate management
* It creates good tax credits
