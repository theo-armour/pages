# Quantified Self

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self
> The quantified self refers both to the cultural phenomenon of self-tracking with technology and to a community of users and makers of self-tracking tools who share an interest in "self-knowledge through numbers".[1] Quantified self practices overlap with the practice of lifelogging and other trends that incorporate technology and data acquisition into daily life, often with the goal of improving physical, mental, and emotional performance. The widespread adoption in recent years of wearable fitness and sleep trackers such as the Fitbit or the Apple Watch,[2] combined with the increased presence of Internet of things in healthcare and in exercise equipment, have made self-tracking accessible to a large segment of the population.

> The Quantified Self is an international community of users and makers of self-tracking tools who share an interest in “self-knowledge through numbers.” If you are tracking for any reason — to answer a health question, achieve a goal, explore an idea, or simply because you are curious — you can find help and support here.

> QSI was an initiative of Hanze UAS in collaboration with the California based social enterprise Quantified Self Labs, LLC. Our work was inspired by the Quantified Self community, with a mission to create and share knowledge about tools and methods for self-tracking. From 2012-2017 QSI served a leading role in bridging Quantified Self practices with higher education and applied research. The Quantified Self Institute at Hanze UAS ended in 2017.

Observations on 6 years of journaling
22 Jun, 2022

Journaling is, without a doubt, the most important thing I do for myself. It is the act of taking the internal mess of thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and structuring and codifying them. It makes the intangible, tangible. Understandable.
