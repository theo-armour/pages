# Letters to my younger self + older self

## Preface

To Do

* Summarize third and fourth ages
* More than "Sticks" and "Carrots". Source, decide and add categories about the person such as: sex, fitness, weight, mentality & happiness, finances, support, intentions
* Add references to [21 questions]( https://heretics-sf.github.io/#pages/21-Questions-for-Seniors.md )
* See also [A Difficult Decision And A Happy Choice: Moving to a Nursing Home]( https://ta.medium.com/a-difficult-decision-and-a-happy-choice-3e82bc2ede5c?sk=92a310eab2a80ae306f99a731253a93a )


## Letter to My Younger Self

Dear Theo

Here are a bunch of vignettes on the joys of aging - all random thoughts off the top of my head. They could use some amplifying, but it's a start. The wake up call is that the first half of your life was well-planned, so how about some planning for the second half?

## Sticks

* Old people never tell you all the things they suffer from
* Old people never tell you their secrets

So let's start spilling some of the beans. Very human beans.

* The older you get, there more there are issues. Your aging process will not be special
* The clock in your brain starts to slow down, so time goes by faster
* Here ( see links below) are a hundred common ailments of the aged. How many will you have?
* The older you get, the more there are things you must do, you have no spare time
* 47 will be the most stressful year of your life. 83 the happiest year.
* As the numbers change so do you. Will you be OK living in your place at 65? At 75? At 85? 95?
* The best time to live your dream is before you die
* You know so many people, it becomes difficult to remember the name of the person you are with right now  
* The smart thing to do is to plan well before you get to be less smart
* Your family can do great things or they can look after you, but they can't do both
* Do not assume that someone will look after you
* You will not age any better than the others
* On average you will age average or below
* The longer you live, the more you outlive friends, family, drinking-buddies, devils-you-know, sorority sisters <i>et al</i>
* You will be just as clueless about aging as anybody else
* People don't get to be very old all by themselves
* The young have the abilities but are clueless. The aged have disabilities but have the clues. Therefore, overall at any age, productivity stays quite constant
* Many people live by watching TV. Watching their favorite channels, they entertain themselves to death
* Adults make children go to school in order to learn how to grow up. But who teaches the elderly how to grow better?
* If you continue to eat what you eat now, you will not be eating what you need to eat when you are my age. You must learn to adapt your eating habits to your current needs.
* You tend to imagine your future you as being something like your younger you. Ha Ha to that!

## Quotes

* Jim Rohn: "Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live."

## Carrots

For every negative, there is a positive. But the number of positives is smaller.

Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way; All happy families are alike;

* Successful aging may be the ultimate challenge to a good life.
* The older you get the more you know what you like and what you don't like. Being happy becomes easier and easier.
* If there are things you like doing - and you are one of the lucky ones - you will have the time and place to do that thing
* If you are old and productive and useful, you are what the world needs. You are what you were made for.


## Letter to my older self

Felicitations on having made it to 90. Given my evil ways, I never imagined you could get here.

Here are some practices that I imagine helped you to arrive here:

* Walk 5,000 steps a day - or some distance that you can track
* Establish maintain simple rules that you obey about food and drink
* Decide a time when anything goes. Perhaps: Life expectancy less than three years??
* Get a hearing aid and know how to use it
* Be able to walk with a walker, cane, handrail and unassisted
* You have coaches for fitness, diet and health
* You are up to date with technology
* You have an engaged dialog with one or more people every day

Martha Nell sent me these lyrics:

	“I can’t believe I’m eighty seven
	By now I thought I’d be in heaven
	My goal was not long life
	But one without pain and strife
	But I will find a way
	To find some joy in every day
	Maybe I will think it’s just great
	To reach the age of eighty-eight”

I have not yet found the source...
