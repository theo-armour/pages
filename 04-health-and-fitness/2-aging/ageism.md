### Do you feel younger people harbor negative stereotypes about older people in San Francisco? Why or why not?

Are positive and negative valid attributes for stereotypes? ;-)

Yes. and

* After being 50 and being disabled, I never considered applying for any job ( bit involved in many failed startups)
* So conscious of ageism, I know well enough not to put myself in a position where it occurs


### Do you think San Francisco’s heavy tech presence, with a focus on innovation and newness, leads to a more pronounced ageism in the area?

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism

* Ageism is a form of discrimination
* "a combination of three connected elements. Among them were prejudicial attitudes towards older people, old age, and the aging process; discriminatory practices against older people; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate stereotypes about elderly people."
* "Ageism is defined as negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people on the basis of their chronological age or on the basis of a perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly'. Ageism can be implicit or explicit and can be expressed on a micro-, meso- or macro-level"

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_embodiment_theory

Stereotype embodiment theory (SET) is a theoretical model first posited by psychologist Becca Levy to explain the process by which age stereotypes influence the health of older adults.[1] There are multiple well-documented effects of age stereotypes on a number of cognitive and physical outcomes (including memory, cardiovascular reactivity, and longevity).

SET explains these findings according to a three-step process:

* Age stereotypes are internalized from the host culture at a young age.
* At some point, these age stereotype become "self stereotypes" about oneself as an aging individual.
* These self-stereotypes are then consciously and unconsciously activated to exert their effects on individual health.


## What I see

* In modern first world circumstances
* the fourth age peeps recuse themselves from participation in the day-to-day world
* Third age peeps prepare for the recusion be becoming consumeers - reading bboks, watching TV, attending performances and incessant traveling

The aged are

* Technically illiterate
* lovers of paper
* Health based on s ingle exercise
* No talk of sex
* No talk of aging health - just about the latest procedure
* Mo movement of housing

Opportunities for the aged

* Minimal opinion
* Maximum check size
* A wealth of talent is wasted
