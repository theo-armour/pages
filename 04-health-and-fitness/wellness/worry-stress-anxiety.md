### Worry

* Worry is what happens when your mind dwells on negative thoughts, uncertain outcomes or things that could go wrong
* When we worry, it calms our brains down
* Worry is also likely to cause us to problem-solve or take action, both of which are positive things
* Worry is a way for your brain to handle problems in order to keep you safe
* When you notice that you’re worried about something, push yourself to come up with a next step or to take action.

### Stress

* Stress is a physiological response connected to an external event
* In order for the cycle of stress to begin, there must be a stressor
* This is usually some kind of external circumstance, like a work deadline or a scary medical test.
* Stress is defined as a reaction to environmental changes or forces that exceed the individual’s resources
* In prehistoric times, stress was a natural response to a threat, like hearing a predator in the bushes.
* Get clear on what you can and can’t control. Then focus your energy on what you can control and accept what you can’t.

### anxiety

* If stress and worry are the symptoms, anxiety is the culmination.
* Anxiety has a cognitive element (worry) and a physiological response (stress), which means that we experience anxiety in both our mind and our body.
* When you’re in the middle of an anxiety episode, talking or thinking about it will not help you.
  * Try to distract yourself with your senses: Listen to music, jump rope for five minutes, or rub a piece of Velcro or velvet.
* Remember: Anxiety happens in your mind and your body so trying to think your way out of it won’t help.

### takeaway

* Worry happens in your mind, stress happens in your body, and anxiety happens in your mind and your body.
* In small doses, worry, stress and anxiety can be positive forces in our lives.
* But research shows that most of us are too worried, too stressed and too anxious.
