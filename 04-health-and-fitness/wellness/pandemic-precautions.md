## Identity C19 awareness among individuals

if somebody comes into the house or into a room not wearing a mask: be more careful.

If somebody comes into a room or house with a mask on and then takes it off: feel safer because their C19 antennae are working.

Even better, masks are not taken off until both parties have assessed the risk.

## Identify travelers

If somebody has been in a train, bus, airplane for several hours, they should be considered risky and treated as you would tra\eat strangers.


## Identify ventilation

If you cannot see an open window or door that is open, then you are not sitting or standing in a safe place. Don't stay more than 15 minutes

If you can see an open opening, but are with strangers, then you can stay for two hours

### Outdoors

if you are in an open area outside, you can feel the wind is blowing, and you see no people upwind from you, then you can feel quite safe.

Same as above and there are people you do not know and they are 10 feet or more away, wearing masks and the interaction is a few minutes or less. This could be people you meet along a path

Avoid walking behind anybody closer than about 30 feet for more than 3 minutes

### Indoors

Stay within your bubble of people as much as possible

In a place with complete strangers

If you cannot see an open window or doors opening and closing frequently then no more than 15 minutes

With a group of friends but outside your bubble

Outside: good distance, mostly masks on, few hours max


If you cannot see an open window or door, no more than 15 minutes

If you can see an open window: two hours


## Indoors, eating and drinking

Keep the distance. Windows must be open!


## Sleeping quarters

* Put the cars outside. Sleep in the garage.
* Keep bathroom doors open when not in use
* Toilet lids down
