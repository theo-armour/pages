Gardner and Bernie

If there is even a single case at the Heritage, my behavior would change a lot

The first case is more likely to appear among staff, skilled nursing and assisted living patients.

It is less likely that a first case will appear in my current close bubble of say 30 or so people that I tend to talk to without a mask on a near daily basis

Therefore the probability is that there will be a warning given before any of the peeps in my bundle test positive

The warning may be days, or hours or even minutes, but there is highly likely to be a warning

A warning of any length will give time me to adapt a new behavior

The issue is only me catching the virus without warning

Possible upcoming venues

Walking around the neighborhood
Visiting a doctor's office
Taking a Lyft
Visiting my old apartment
Having a drink at an outdoor restaurant by myself
Having a drink at an outdoor restaurant with others safe
Having a drink at an outdoor restaurant with others who may be unsafe
Going to Safeway
Going to Cleaners ~ 90 second interaction with door open
Going for a car or van ride with people in my bubble


## General Guidance

* Do not go into a store or similar establishment
	* unless you see the front door open - or many other openings open to fresh air.
	* if you see people inside not wearing masks
	* If, while you are standing outside, can see more than a dozen or so people - avoid crowding
* If you cannot see a mask - on the face or even in hand or on the neck - steer clear of that person.
	* A visible mask in an indication that the person is covid-aware
* If you cannot see a mask, treat the person as a covidiot
* Avoid public transport
* If you must use public transport, take a bus
	* Do not use a service that uses underground stations
	* Do not get on a bus unless you see a vacant seat with several vacant rows behind and in front or at least 8 feet awaty from anybody else
	* Do not get on a bus if you cannot see open windows
* Taxi, Uber or Lyft
* Windows open







I am not a statistician. nonetheless I can think out loud.

Let us say that your chance or probability of catching the covid-19 virus is X.

if you live by yourself, then the chance of you catching the virus at home is X

if you live with another person then they may catch the virus and give it to you. Therefore your chance of getting the virus is to X.

if there are two other people living in your establishment. then there are three people living together and you might think that your chances of getting the virus are 3x.

but one of the other residents may pass the virus on to the other person who winter and passes it on to you. they're for the three of you have a chance that is 3 factorial or 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.

if you live with three other people then the probability is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 or 24X.

the rates are transmission between people and the timing and duration of proximity and whatever are far more complex than these numbers indicate.

if you live in a group home and one of the members catches the virus and you are all in Fairly good contact with each other then the probability that you will catch the virus goes through the roof.

if you live by yourself and are fairly careful when you go out then you should be okay.

if you live with others then you must, must be extra vigilant.
