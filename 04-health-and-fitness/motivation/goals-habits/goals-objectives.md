# Goals vs Objectives

Goals are broad, long-term outcomes that represent what you want to achieve, while objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) steps that define how you will reach those goals. Goals provide the overall vision and direction, whereas objectives provide the detailed roadmap, breaking the journey into manageable, actionable steps to achieve the desired results. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Goals

• Broad and General: Goals are wide-ranging statements about desired future states or major achievements. [2, 4]
• Long-Term: They typically represent a longer-term vision for the future. [1, 5]
• Abstract/Intangible: Goals are often intangible and may not have specific, quantifiable measurements. [4]
• Provides Direction: They offer a clear direction and a sense of purpose. [4, 6, 7]

## Objectives

• Specific and Measurable: Objectives are detailed, quantifiable, and clearly defined, outlining exactly what needs to be done. [2, 4]
• Short-Term: Objectives are generally shorter-term targets, designed to be accomplished within a specific timeframe. [1, 5]
• Action-Oriented: They are concrete actions or tasks that need to be performed. [4]
• Measurable Outcomes: Objectives provide tangible targets and benchmarks to track progress and success. [4, 8]

## Analogy
Think of your goal as a mountain you want to summit. The objectives are the individual trails, base camps, and specific milestones you'll hit along the way to reach that summit. [4]
Example

• Goal: To increase your overall physical fitness. [1]
• Objectives:
 • To run 5 kilometers in 30 minutes within three months. [2, 9]
 • To attend the gym three times a week for the next six weeks. [1, 4]
 • To increase your weight training capacity by 10% in the next quarter. [2, 8, 10]
