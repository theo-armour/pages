### 1.HEALTH GOALS

I start with this one because you can’t take care of others if you’re not taken care of first, right? Ask any mother who’s sick with the husband or partner nowhere in sight. This is actually the BASIS of the Stella Nadene Health + Wellness site. Your health should be a priority so that you’re in optimal mental, emotional, and physical condition to live the life you deserve, and that your family deserves! So whether this is losing weight, getting your cholesterol to a certain number, or getting in exercise every week, I promise you that you will feel a thousand times better once you implement a plan based on goals for your health.

I definitely recommend seeing the doc for some blood work to make sure everything’s where it should be. This will help pinpoint any issues that need to be addressed that you may not have known about. For example, finding out that you have metabolic syndrome makes any goal of losing weight have a whole new motivational factor.

Basic recommendations for every day:

1-Get good and enough sleep,

2-Eat clean and cut the sugar,

3-Get in some movement every single day

4-Manage your stress levels like your life depends on it. (It does.)


### 2. CAREER GOALS

According to Forbes, 87% of workers are either not engaged or actively disengaged in their jobs. The list of reasons is far and many. But bottom line is that you’re very likely to be in that 87%. Even if you happen to be in the 13% of happy employees, are you really satisfied to do what you’re doing for the rest of your career?

Are you interested in a different field? Do you need more training or a higher education? Or even just a different degree of study? Maybe you want to climb the ladder where you’re at. Or own your own business doing what you’re already doing. Whatever you would rather be doing is where you need to start with setting these types of life goals.


You’re the only person that can answer these questions to get to the root of where you want to head.

So ask yourself: If I had so much money I could never spend it all, what would I want to do every day? Your answer should give you an inkling of what kind of career will make it a pleasure to go to work every day.


### 3. ROMANCE OR RELATIONSHIP GOALS

Your relationship with your significant other can grow warily stale over the years, especially after having kids. It’s always in your best interest (as long as there’s no abuse or infidelity going on) to nurture the relationship. This person has vowed to spend the rest of their life with you, and you with them. Why wouldn’t you want it to be epic??!

Not only that—but this person should be your rock, your support. If you expect them to be your rock and nurture like you need, you also have to nurture as well. It’s a two-way street, marriage.

### 4. FAMILY + FRIENDS GOALS

Now I realize that you normally don’t control who you meet and where, but you can decide who you actually keep in your life as a friend or acquaintance. This plays into the goal factor in that, you will find a time when you become so incredibly busy that you don’t have the capacity to deal with one-sided friendships and/or constant drama from that one extended family member that always seems to have a crisis going on.

It’s emotionally draining if you’re the go-to support for cousin Tammy. I realize that sounds a little selfish, but sometimes you have to pare people out of your life for your own sanity. But also so that you have the capacity to spend time with your kids and husband. Those people, and yourself, will always be your first priority.


Whether this includes time spent with your kids, or time spent with your parents/grandparents that are getting up there in age, or even more time spent with your sister who used to be your very best friend, your family deserves attention and time spent with them, too.

The relationships that you’ve valued over the years should be evident by your actions toward that person/those people, including your friends. Female friendships have been shown to lower stress levels crazy amounts because of the support women lend to each other.

Let them know how much you care about them. Do this by writing them into your goals to commit to time spent with them! Everyone should have equal time with families and friends.

And the second part of this goal should including parenting. As a parent for 19 years now, I can tell you that some of our biggest arguments have come in regards to parenting. In this crazy-busy tech-driven world we live in, sometimes we forget to stop and be present with those little babies we wanted in this world.

We’re responsible for teaching them nearly everything, and how to be a great parent is one of those responsibilities. Take time with them. Praise them. Give them boundaries. Make connections. You don’t have a long time to do this, so take advantage while the time is here!


### 5. FINANCIAL TYPES OF GOALS EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE

Seriously, you need to have a financial plan in place, and you need to clean up your messes before you’re in a Code Black (Red?) situation. Find any one of the financial gurus online that you can, create a plan, and work through it.

By using tools and road maps from one of these financial gurus, we’ve gotten out of a mountain of credit card debt, pared-down our student loans, own both of our vehicles, have our savings accounts in place, our IRA is on track, and we’re on the road to paying off our home. Which means that we have the funds to do home projects we’ve been waiting on, go on really cool vacations, and send our kids to whatever after school lessons or camps they want.

Financial goals can absolutely be some of the toughest types of goals in life to accomplish. But the lessons learned along the way are for life (and should be instilled in your kids early on!)

Having finances in order can open the door to a clarity of your mind that is truly liberating! Even if you’re on a tight budget to accomplish those goals, having boundaries can help give you something to control when the rest of your life may feel totally out of control.

### 6. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT GOALS

Physical environment goals deal with the place you spend most of your time, whether that includes your lovely abode, your office/desk space at work, or even the gym.

Studies show that our physical environment can affect productivity + quality of life tremendously.

Few people are actually in their ‘dream home’. There’s always something that people want improved upon on their home to make things more ‘livable’, or ‘pretty’, or ‘functional’. Any of these 3 things can reduce your stress levels.

If you don’t have a lot of control over your office environment at work, do the little things that you can. Maybe you’re in a cubicle and can only change stuff there. Start small and see how it makes you feel. Then go from there. (For example, bringing in a plant, or covering the standard cubicle tacky grey with a fun fabric print and then loading it with pics from your family or inspirational quotes.)

On the home front, figure out what would make you and your family happy. Write these home goals into your big master plan. Even if it’s something as simple as organizing the pantries.


### 7. SPIRITUAL GOALS

I grew up in the South—meaning: Southern Baptist church. Lots of things being frowned upon that are fun. Like cussing, or dancing, or having a drink. All things I very much like to do. Once I started studying religion, and had a very enlightening conversation with a friend that studied this at the college level, I realized that one set religion does not a spiritual being make.

My husband grew up in a non-denominational church, so he didn’t understand the whole ‘singing hymns out of a hymn book with only a piano playing’ type of music. I wasn’t used to it being like a rock concert. But I really freaking liked it. So now we’re raising our kids in a non-denominational church and loving it.

I also feel like you can believe in God but have a different name for him. And you can worship in ways other than sitting in a church pew every Sunday. And—gasp!—you can also be close to God by learning about energies in the universe.

My point is that you grow, and learn about yourself, and the universe, and the whole world around you when you set goals for your spirituality. Maybe it’s a retreat, maybe it’s committing to serving meals with the church once a month, and maybe it’s just writing in a Gratitude Journal every night.

Everyone’s spiritual journey will be different. But your innermost soul is nourished when you take the time for it.


### 8. LEISURE GOALS

What do you like to do in your free time? You know…assuming you have tiny amounts as a busy mom. (Yes, I realize that sounds like a giant oxymoron. But go with me here…) Do you like taking family vacations? Girls-only trips? Or is it learning a new skill like painting or doing a fun outing to learn rock climbing?

Gather your and your family goals to help each other. Time off is a HUGE stress management tool. But it also helps build relationships with those people you share these experiences with.


***

This list can sound like a huge undertaking, no doubt. But working with your life in segments, and seeking improvement by first creating goals will set you up for some serious success and fulfillment.

### Spiritual

This is that inner part of yourself. That’s that deep need that we all have to be a part of something greater than ourselves, to make a difference in the world, or to make an impact. This is going to be different for everybody. If you’re a Christian, let your Christian faith drive how you set goals in this area. For others, who may not be religious or practice a religion, that’s okay. Maybe for you it’s you want to get out and take more nature hikes or you want to get out and meditate more or just have some more down time. Whatever feeds that soul part of you, put down some goals.

### Personal Development

This is your mind. Ask yourself this: how are you going to be better at who you are? How are you going to be a better husband, wife, father or mother? What is it that you’re going to do to grow yourself? What do you need to learn? What do you need to read? What events do you need to attend? What classes do you need to take? Set some goals for yourself and focus on “how am I going to be a better person? What am I going to do to grow myself?”

### Health

What are you going to do to take care of this instrument, this tool that you have? What are you going to do to feed yourself correctly? Get the right rest you know so you have more energy, so you can actually accomplish all those things that you’re setting out to accomplish? This one’s pretty straight forward. I think we all know what we need to do, but we just don’t often do it, right? So don’t try and set goals that are ridiculous here. This isn’t about having six pack abs. It’s about being healthy and feeling good at the end of each year.

### Romance

What are you going to do to bring the romance back into your relationships? There is no relationship that we have while we are on this Earth that’s more important than a romantic relationship, than the one with our spouse, the person that we looked at and went “this is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with”. That’s the most important relationship you have, so how are you going to keep the romance and how are you going to have some fun with it? And yes, guys, you can put some goals as it pertains to maybe getting in the sack a little more, but you’ve got to do something to get there first. I would encourage you to sit down and put some goals together with your partner, with the person you’re in that romantic relationship with, because it’s going to make this fun! It’s going to make this a whole lot more fun than maybe it would be if you just did it on your own.

### Family

A lot of times people put this category and the family category together, but these two areas need to be broken apart. Your romantic relationship is the most important and if that relationship is healthy, it allows for your family relationship to be healthier. Your relationship with your kids, your relationship with your extended family all hinges on having a first and foremost a healthy romantic relationship. Here’s where you’re going to put your family goals. Do you want to invest in your kids soccer league a little bit more or spend more time coaching? Or do you want to see your extended family, make more trips or pay for them to come out and visit you? You want to have some goals and some things you’re working on to improve your family relationships.

### Business/Career

What are you going to do in your business or career that’s going to move it forward? This category will probably have the most number of goals. It will probably have more goals that the other areas, because it’s the one area or the one category that deals with your professional life. All the other ones tend to deal more with your personal life, though they may have some bleed over, but this is the one that is solely dedicated to your professional life, everything else is to your personal life. So if you add up all the personal categories, they will probably outnumber the goals you have here, but don’t feel like “oh my gosh, I have six goals for my business and only two for my family…does that make me a crappy father?” No, it just means that you’ve got other areas or goals for other areas and that this is just one category for one big area of life. So you want to put your business or your career goals in here.

### Finances

What do you want to achieve financially? Do you want to buy a house? Do you want to increase the amount you’re saving this year? Do you want to pay off some debt? Student loans? What are some financial goals you have for yourself? Put those down so you know  what you’re working towards and again, if you’re in a romantic relationship or if you share funds with your spouse, this is something you’re probably going to want to work on with them so that you’re both on board and on the same page.

### Fun and Recreation

What are you going to do for fun? Are you going to take vacations? Are you going to join a hockey league? One of our clients, she is a very athletic person. She’s awesome. She’s got so much energy and she’s involved in hockey, she’s involved in marathons, and that’s what she does for fun. When she’s not at work, she’s out there on the athletic field and so that’s how she spends her fun and that’s what she does for her recreation. For others, it’s vacations or weekends away. It’s time with friends. Whatever it is for you, put some goals down. Say “what do I want to do this year that’s going to be fun?” Skydiving? Hang-gliding? Surfing? Whatever it is, put it down.

### Social

This is your friendships, this is your relationships outside of family and this is what you’re going to do socially. Do you want to spend more time with your friends? Whatever changes you want to make in your social life, put them in this category.




## https://www.aconsciousrethink.com/8586/types-of-goals/


### Educational Goals

To grow and change, first we must learn. You may think of education as just school, but it goes further into university studies, vocational courses, and professional qualifications.

It’s no surprise, then, that educational goals are likely to change as you move through formal education, come out into a career, and then negotiate your way through promotions and changes of direction.

The key is to remember that the time for education is never past. Lifelong learning is an opportunity to expand your mind in so many ways, so don’t think of education as something which is only relevant to the young.

The goals you may identify in relation to education will differ according to your chosen career path. Maybe, though, they’ll extend as far as preparing for a career change in the future which will require re-training in a whole new area.


### Physical & Health Goals

Our body, health, and physical capabilities have a major influence on our lives and what we are able to achieve.

Goals in this area will differ vastly depending on your age and your existing state of health.

If you’re young and fit, you’re likely to want to push yourself further and faster, with a significant physical fitness goal such as a marathon as your target.

If you’re a middle-aged and desk-bound exec who’s let things slide (in every sense!), then just keeping within normal ranges for your age may well be your aspiration – make no mistake, though, that is still a goal!

Maybe you’re targeting a long life, and to stay mentally and physically active as appropriate for each life stage.

### Relationship Goals

While we are all complete in ourselves, the people in our lives play a huge role in how we feel and what we can accomplish.

Relationship goals are interesting because they’re often unselfish goals that are set for yourself, and will be life enhancing, but are also for the benefit of significant others.

How successful you are at achieving them will have a deep impact on your personal happiness.

Clearly, there’s the not insignificant task of finding a life partner and how to achieve that, if that’s your dream. Once that box is ticked, caring for that person and any children you have will doubtless create further goals for you.

Making sure you dedicate sufficient quality time both to your relationship and to your family and friends, and improving your work/life balance might be what you’re aiming for.

### Personal Development Goals

Change is the only universal constant, and that goes for each and every one of us. We can develop in so many different ways depending on what we value most.

Maybe you feel the need to stretch yourself mentally or physically by learning another language, learning to salsa, or mastering some new technique.

Maybe not.

The need for personal development is just that: personal.

Some people seem to have a limitless capacity to take on and master new challenges. That’s fine and dandy, but their goals shouldn’t be yours and you shouldn’t let yourself be so awed by their acumen that you don’t get off the starting blocks.

Personal development is great, but the drive needs to come from within.

Broadening your mind through travel or reading, learning new skills, and the catch-all ‘self-improvement’ all come under the umbrella of personal enrichment.

Chances are you’ll have a few ideas in this category. It matters not whether the list is long or short.

### Career Goals

We spend a huge chunk of our lives working. So don’t you think it’s wise to have some goals in place for such an important area of your life?

As mentioned before, this category is inextricably connected with education because you can’t really have one without the other. Making the effort to study and actively improve your skill set may open up new career avenues for you.

Most of us have a few ideas up our sleeve about our working future. Your goal may be to start your own business, to gain a particular accolade, to get a promotion, or to increase your earning power.

The act of making a concrete list of career goals, forming the basis of a master plan for your own career development, is empowering. It could be the first step to a new future.

### Financial Goals

Money makes the world go round – or at least, it does to an extent.

No wonder it’s one of the most popular areas when it comes to goal setting. No matter what rung of the ladder we’re currently on, most of us have aspirations and ambitions with the ultimate aim of making more money.

Perhaps you’re unfortunate enough to be in debt at present. If so, setting targets for your budget and seeking ways to adjust your spending habits will be top of your list.

If your dream is to buy a house, then identifying ways to save to make that dream a reality will be high on the agenda.

Retirement is another matter that requires careful thought and advance planning, so there may be some ‘stepping stone’ goals along the way with this in mind.

### Spiritual Goals

Since your spiritual life is your compass, this is another area which is interconnected with other types of goals – relationships and personal development, for example.

Whether or not you follow a particular religious faith, development of your spiritual side underpins pretty much everything you do.

Maybe you’ll set yourself the goal of freeing up the time to do some voluntary work or donating more money to those who are less fortunate.

Maybe your aspirations are to get involved in a charitable development project overseas.

On the other hand, you may just feel the need to be more mindful or to meditate regularly.


### Psychological Goals

Your mind is where it’s at. Life that is. What we create, what happens to us and around us, what we think and feel – everything is processed by and in the mind.

So it makes sense that you might want to set some goals that relate to how your mind interacts with the world. How you perceive things, what you believe, your attitudes toward events and people, your mindset.

Your mind is the most powerful tool you have in your locker, so be willing to work on it and set goals for how you’d like it to operate.

Maybe that means learning to stay calm in situations that currently stress you out. Perhaps it’s being more open-minded to opportunities that present themselves.

Whatever it is, your mind is able to adapt and change if you have the desire to make it happen.

### External Goals

Most goals solely focus on your life, your success, or your dreams, but you can also set goals that put someone else first.

This was touched upon under spiritual goals and doing charitable work, but it can be far more than this.

For example, imagine that you want to live your life in a way that causes the least suffering to others. This might encompass becoming vegetarian (or only eating free range produce), minimizing your impact on the environment, or paying a little extra for ethically sourced clothes.

Or, the focus of your goal might be closer to home. Perhaps you want to help a sibling out of a tricky financial situation or support your best friend as they go through a divorce.

External goals often overlap with other areas such as financial or career. Perhaps you need a certain amount of money to help someone out, or a flexible job that gives you the time to dedicate to a cause.

### Experiential Goals

Our life is made up of a series of experiences. Some experiences are mundane – driving to work, for instance – while others are truly life affirming.

If there is something that you want to do before your time is up, set a goal around it.

Do you want to bask in the northern lights and all their colorful magnificence?

How about walking the red carpet at a Hollywood film premiere?

Or is your dream to sail around the Galapagos Islands to see the amazing wildlife there?

Understandably, many experiential goals will also tie into other types of goals.
