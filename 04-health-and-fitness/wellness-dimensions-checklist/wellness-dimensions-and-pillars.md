## Preface

### 2022-09-11

Many of the links listed below are, essentially, marketing documents. They are used to highlight health features offered by an organization. There are few if any footnotes or references in any of the documents relating to how the document was prepared and what sources were used.

A few sites offer links to resources that might be helpful in achieving wellness in a particular category: A nice example: https://mywellness.ucsf.edu/#/resources/emotional

None of the sites provide and targets or goals or offer any metrics or ways of measuring degrees of wellness.

Much of this is to be expected. I am using Google to track "wellness". If I had easy access to JSTOR, my search results might be quite different.

Luckily I found a gold mine:

[The Scope and Challenges of the Wellness Activities of the Older Adults]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323084807_The_Scope_and_Challenges_of_the_Wellness_Activities_of_the_Older_Adults/citations )

>This study had a dual purpose:
>1) to determine the range of wellness activities of the senior citizens (third agers) based on six dimensions of wellness, and
>2) to ascertain the problems and challenges which third agers face in holding wellness activities. The senior citizens’ leader of each municipality of Bukidnon served as respondents. A survey questionnaire was designed to gather both quantitative and qualitative data. Included in the instrument were also pertinent open-ended questions. The analysis made use of the model of Hettler (cited in MacMahan and Fleur, 2012) that reflects the six dimensions of wellness, as well as Hawk’s (1994) model showing a one-to-one correspondence between Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, with the dimensions of wellness.
>
>Results showed that the spiritual and physical wellness activities were most often conducted, while intellectual and emotional activities were scarce. Leadership was repeatedly cited as one of the reasons to explain the shortage of activities. The study’s results implied the absence of balanced wellness and concluded that the presumably elderly’s spiritual wellness does not necessarily mean they have achieved ‘self-actualization.’ To address the various wellness dimensions to develop holistically healthy third agers, a university-led wellness program may be designed, developed and implemented.

A direct link to the paper is available here:

The paper reports on specific activities undertaken by respondents as well statistics on the occurrence of activities.

My next step will be to take Dr Torres list of Activities and use it as a model for creating a list of activities that might be relevant to residents in a US retirement community.




### 2022-08-08 ~ We all want to be "healthy", yet we all seem to have our own unique visions of what "being healthy" really means. Me being me, figuring out my health is long, drawn out, rather exhaustive investigation.

In the following text, you will find my investigations into other people's definitions. Ultimately the process leads to a definition of my personal definition - which also ends being a checklist that I can use to monitor and measure the rise and fall of my own wellness.

Currently, the effort is about:

* Gathering definitions of the dimensions of wellness from a large variety of authoritative sources.
* Building up a master list of all the the dimension titles that have been found
* Creating our own set of dimensions based on what we've found
* Building a list of keywords or tags that may be associated with a particular dimension

Example

The physical dimension might include the following keywords: exercise, nutrition, sleep, sexual health, and making healthy decisions.

Considerations

* Our list is oriented toward the elderly
* A prime use for the effort is to assist in care-giver and patient dialogs


## Introduction

Most of us want to be healthy. But what is "healthy"? And how do we stay healthy?

If you (or your parents) are in the eighties or nineties, obviously you (or they) have not been that unhealthy. Most likely, however, any elderly person has a bunch of issues. The issues can be medical, financial, cognitive or any number of other issues.

Most of us want to live at least another five years or so. For most of us, just living as we have been living in the recent past is sufficient to let live for the next five.

Some of us, however, have pre-existing conditions or risky behavior patterns or are just plain curious about what the future as an elderly person may bring.

If you are one of these types then this paper is for you. Or at least it may be sometime in the future because it is an ongoing work in progress.

So let's go back to the beginning: What is health?

> Health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity"

This then demands the question? What is well-being? It turns out that well-being is an omnibus term with many meanings. Fortunately there is a related term that is more physical than existential; more individual and societal. The term is "wellness".

Even better, there is a large corpus of writing on "wellness dimensions" and "pillars of wellness".


## Vision

Given a primary set of criteria, you as a competant individual may ascertain your overall state of health to a caregiver

Given a primary set of criteria, you as a moderately cognitively-impaired individual may use the criteria to help you to remember to describe your overall state of health to a care-giver.

Given a caregiver may use these criteria to investigate the general state of health of a severely-cognitively impaired person


## Mission

To provide metrics and targets for the full range of known health criteria.

#### What Are the 8 Pillars of Wellness?

The idea of incorporating eight pillars into your routine might sound daunting as you begin your wellness journey. But chances are, you’re already using at least a few of these pillars already. We’ll break down each pillar and give you actionable steps to develop them in your life.

#### 1. Physical
Physical wellness includes much more than just exercise. Regular physical activity is certainly a component of this pillar, but there are several other aspects that make up holistic physical wellness, including healthy hygiene and sleep habits.

The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults ages 18 to 64 get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night and that adults over 65 get seven to eight hours per night. You can help yourself get a better night’s sleep by turning off your devices 30 minutes before bedtime and using blackout curtains and white-noise machines to block light and sound as you try to fall asleep.

When it comes to hygiene, establishing proper habits will not only make you healthier but also more confident. Bathing regularly, trimming and cleaning underneath your nails, and washing your hands are all important when it comes to building up this physical pillar of wellness.

Try: Brushing your teeth twice a day, every day, for two minutes each brushing. We’ve all heard the importance of brushing your teeth from our parents growing up and dentists later in life, but a quick brush isn’t doing your teeth any favors. Buy a two-minute timer for your bathroom and set it each time you brush to ensure you’re getting the most out of this important hygiene routine.

#### 2. Nutritional
Though nutrition also falls under physical wellness, it’s such an important component of overall health that it’s represented in its own pillar. Ensuring you’re eating a balanced diet is essential to building this pillar in your life. The CDC recommends adults emphasize a diet mixed with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products. It’s also recommended that adults steer away from foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars.

Everyone’s dietary needs are a little different depending on their age, sex, activity level, and body chemistry. Check with your doctor to find a diet plan that works for you. This might include altering the types of foods you eat or adding in some supplements.

Eating and nutrition are closely linked with your mouth and the health of your teeth. There are certain foods that aren’t great for your teeth health and can even stain them. Foods that are acidic (like cranberry juice and tomato sauce), dark or bright-colored vegetables (like pomegranates and beets), drinks filled with tannins (like wine and coffee), and foods high in sugar all have the ability to stain your teeth. Regulating your intake of these foods and drinks will help to keep your mouth healthy as you begin to build this pillar.

Try: Replacing refined grains with their whole counterparts to make sure you get enough fiber. Making sure your diet has enough fiber can help with weight loss and maintenance and can also lower your cholesterol.

#### 3. Emotional *
The emotional wellness pillar covers your feelings, as well as how easily you can understand and navigate your emotions and also communicate them with others. We’re all likely to experience hardships and the emotions that come with them, but our ability to take a step back and evaluate how these emotions impact our behaviors is an important part of overall wellness.

Being in control of your emotions or at least aware of how they can impact your relationships is a crucial part of your overall holistic wellness. If you’re ever feeling out of control when it comes to regulating your emotions or communicating them with others, it might be a good idea to talk with your doctor about seeking professional help you build this pillar in your life.

Try: Journaling as part of your daily routine. Even for the times that everything is going right, journaling can help you reflect on the parts of your life that bring you happiness and parts that don’t. It can also be a way to work through feelings you might not feel comfortable talking about with others.

#### 4. Social *
Social wellness encompasses our connections and relationships with others. Humans are social creatures by nature and through daily interactions, we’re able to see ourselves through the eyes of others and learn who we are and how we fit in the world. Beyond building positive relationships with others, this pillar of wellness also includes the ability to resolve any conflict that might arise in a healthy and respectful manner.

Healthy friendships and relationships create a strong support system to reach out to when stresses rise and hardships happen. Building and maintaining these relationships takes dedication but they will continue to serve you throughout your life.

Try: Scheduling monthly check-in calls with friends you don’t get to see that often. This will help hold you accountable and remind you of the importance of checking in with friends regardless of what’s happening in your life — good or bad.


#### 5. Spiritual *
The spiritual pillar of wellness is unique to each person and their spirituality. Spirituality is defined as the traditions and values by which people live. This helps to give people a sense of purpose and meaning to life, which, in turn, helps guide actions.

Many people develop this pillar through meditation, prayer, or other means of fostering a connection with a higher power. Similar to social wellness, spiritual wellness is an important component that helps us work through tough times and develop resiliency and grace when we face obstacles in life.

Try: Practicing meditation. You can do this by sitting or lying in a comfortable spot, closing your eyes, and letting yourself breathe naturally. Pay attention to your breath and notice the movement of your body as you breathe. If your mind wanders, return your attention back to your breath. Try this for two to three minutes and repeat daily, working yourself up to longer intervals.

#### 6. Intellectual
Intellectual wellness is built by opening yourself up to experiences that inform and challenge your thinking. Developing a healthy thirst for knowledge long after formal education has ended is a great way to form new skills and interests throughout your life. This can be as simple as having deep, intellectual conversations with friends and family or setting aside time each day to play brain puzzles like crosswords or Sudoku.

Try: Joining a book club. Being a part of a reading group will help hold you accountable and inspire stimulating conversations about insights and learnings from the book.

#### 7. Financial *
Financial wellness is the pillar devoted to living within your means and planning for your future appropriately. It can be tough to start developing this pillar, but you’ll be glad you did. Being financially well trickles over into several other pillars, such as physical and emotional wellness, as money troubles can take a toll on a person’s mind and body.

Try: Setting aside a fixed amount of money each month for the things you value most in life, whether that’s money for your hobbies, dining out, or saving toward a vacation.

#### 8. Environmental *
Environmental wellness deals with your immediate surroundings and the community where you live and work. This involves respecting the environment you live in by doing your best to support it however you can. This might include recycling or volunteering to clean up a city park that you frequent.

Try: Cutting back on your time in the car by opting for a bike ride or a walk if your destination is close. If it’s farther away, consider taking public transportation or carpooling with friends.
