Activated charcoal: This is a natural substance that can absorb gas and toxins in the digestive system, which may help reduce bloating and discomfort.

Peppermint oil: Peppermint oil is a natural antispasmodic that can help relax the muscles in the digestive tract and relieve gas and bloating.

Ginger: Ginger has been traditionally used to treat digestive issues, including bloating and gas. It can help stimulate digestion and reduce inflammation in the gut.

Fennel: Fennel is a natural carminative, which means it can help reduce gas and bloating by promoting the expulsion of gas from the digestive system.

Probiotics: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help improve digestion and reduce gas and bloating. They work by restoring the natural balance of gut bacteria, which can be disrupted by factors like antibiotics, stress, and poor diet.

FODMAPs: FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. They can cause gas and bloating in some people. A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce gas and bloating by limiting the amount of FODMAPs in the diet.
