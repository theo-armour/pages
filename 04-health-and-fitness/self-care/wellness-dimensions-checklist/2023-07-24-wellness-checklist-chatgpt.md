As people age, their priorities and needs in terms of wellness may change. Here is a reasonable list of "Dimensions of Wellness" for individuals in their eighties and nineties in the US, along with brief descriptions of each dimension:

Physical Wellness: This dimension focuses on maintaining and improving the body's overall health and functionality. It includes activities such as staying physically active, eating a balanced diet, managing chronic conditions, and ensuring regular medical check-ups. Gentle exercises like walking, stretching, or Tai Chi can be beneficial for seniors.

Emotional Wellness: Emotional wellness involves managing and expressing emotions in a healthy way. Seniors may benefit from maintaining strong social connections, engaging in hobbies or activities that bring joy, and seeking support for any emotional challenges they may face. Mindfulness practices and meditation can also be helpful for emotional well-being.

Social Wellness: This dimension emphasizes the importance of maintaining social connections and relationships with family, friends, and the community. Engaging in social activities, attending events, or participating in clubs or support groups can foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation or loneliness.

Intellectual Wellness: Intellectual wellness involves keeping the mind active and engaged. Seniors can promote intellectual wellness by reading books, solving puzzles, playing brain-training games, taking classes or workshops, and pursuing lifelong learning opportunities.

Occupational Wellness: While retirement is common in the eighties and nineties, some seniors may still find purpose and fulfillment in activities related to their previous profession or other hobbies. Engaging in volunteer work or mentoring others can also contribute to a sense of occupational wellness.

Spiritual Wellness: This dimension relates to finding meaning and purpose in life. Seniors may explore spirituality through religious practices, meditation, nature walks, or engaging in activities that connect them to a higher purpose or a sense of inner peace.

Environmental Wellness: Environmental wellness involves creating a living environment that supports health and well-being. Seniors can optimize their living spaces for safety, comfort, and accessibility, ensuring that their surroundings promote a sense of peace and security.

Financial Wellness: Financial wellness addresses the ability to manage one's financial resources effectively. It includes creating a budget, managing expenses, ensuring access to healthcare, and protecting against potential financial risks.

Cultural Wellness: This dimension acknowledges the importance of cultural identity and involvement in cultural activities or events that bring joy and foster a sense of community.

It's important to note that individual needs and preferences may vary, and not all seniors will prioritize the same dimensions of wellness. Additionally, it's essential to consult with healthcare professionals and geriatric specialists to tailor wellness strategies to each individual's unique health status and goals.
