_What is a reasonable checklist for a wellness interaction?_


## Preface

My new [primary care physician (PCP)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician ) is with [Pine Park Health]( https://www.pineparkhealth.com/ ) and their excellent staff. As a patient of a for-profit health-provider start-up that is well-funded, I can revel in the delight of having "top-notch" ( better term please? ) care-givers come to my residence and talk to me for an entire hour on a regular basis.

How best to use that time?

* Keep it short, let the session terminate early and allow the care-givers to do whatever care-givers do?
* Sit there, waiting for the next question and answering them off the top of my head?
* Keep talking about whatever comes to mind?
* Use a checklist to identify, prioritize and monitor wellness

Me being me, I choose to follow the last item. ;-)


## Why?

_The why is never easy. Here are some ideas_

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician,_heal_thyself
* You are your own healer
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_healer
* [_Zen and the Art of Wellness Maintenance_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance )
* Wellness is a project that requires and is helped with good project management tools
* Following [Maslow]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs ) _et al_: reduce insecurity and increase beauty


## Narrative

_Draft of a naive text_

The dialog between care-giver and patient has extremes.

The more the care-giver asks questions, the more the care-giver anticipates what the next question ought to be.

The more the patient babbles on, the more time the care-giver has to think things over.

The trick is not to just let the patient babble on interminably nor to let the care-giver just ask questions interminably.

The successful dialog has just the right mix of questions and responses.

A possible method to assist in achieving success may be to agree a standard checklist of topics that care-giver and patient may discuss in the course of a session.


## Vision

A patient and care-giver session results in

The patient and care-giver feeling
* The interchange has been honest
* The interchange has been revealing
* The interchange has been productive
* Goals have been set, maintained and extended

The patient
* Is learning something
* Feels progress has been made
* Notices that behaviors are being modified nicely

The care-giver
* Feels agency
* Leaves with good things to think about
* Is learning something


## Draft of a Checklist

_First pass at looking at establishing no more than eight categories medical wellness_

The checklist is roughly based on an effort to identify my personal [Dimensions and Pillars of Wellness]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/readme.html#pages/health/wellness-dimensions-and-pillars.md )

Each of the following could include

* What happened since the previous session?
* What were the issues and successes since the previous session?
* What to look forward to?
