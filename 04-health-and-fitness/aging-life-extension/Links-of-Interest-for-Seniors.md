### Aging & Old Age

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing
>Ageing or aging (see spelling differences) is the process of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially biologically immortal. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population ageing).

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion
>The end-of-history illusion is a psychological illusion in which individuals of all ages believe that they have experienced significant personal growth and changes in tastes up to the present moment, but will not substantially grow or mature in the future. Despite recognizing that their perceptions have evolved, individuals predict that their perceptions will remain roughly the same in the future.


### Gerontology

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology
> Gerontology is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_gerontology
> Financial Gerontology is a multidisciplinary field of study encompassing both academic and professional education, that integrates research on aging and human development with the concerns of finance and business.
> In particular, research and teaching in financial gerontology draws upon four kinds of aging or "'four lenses" through which aging and finance can be viewed: population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging

### Geriatrics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics
>Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults.

### Geriatric Care Management

Definitions

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatric_care_management
> Geriatric care management is the process of planning and coordinating care of the elderly and others with physical and/or mental impairments to meet their long term care needs, improve their quality of life, and maintain their independence for as long as possible. It entails working with persons of old age and their families in managing, rendering and referring various types of health and social care services. Geriatric care managers accomplish this by combining a working knowledge of health and psychology, human development, family dynamics, public and private resources as well as funding sources, while advocating for their clients throughout the continuum of care. For example, they may assist families of older adults and others with chronic needs such as those suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.


* https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-geriatric-care-manager
>A geriatric care manager, usually a licensed nurse or social worker who specializes in geriatrics, is a sort of "professional relative" who can help you and your family to identify needs and find ways to meet your needs.


### Law of Jante ;-)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante

Good rules to follow when you are in a independent living community.

> You are not to think you're anyone special, or that you're better than us.

The ten rules state:

* You're not to think you are anything special.
* You're not to think you are as good as we are.
* You're not to think you are smarter than we are.
* You're not to imagine yourself better than we are.
* You're not to think you know more than we do.
* You're not to think you are more important than we are.
* You're not to think you are good at anything.
* You're not to laugh at us.
* You're not to think anyone cares about you.
* You're not to think you can teach us anything.


### Age Related Diseases

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging-associated_diseases
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Aging-associated_diseases
* https://www.agingresearch.org/health-topic/
* https://www.ncoa.org/blog/10-common-chronic-diseases-prevention-tips/
> Age, family genetics, and gender make it nearly impossible for older adults to avoid becoming a chronic disease statistic. Eighty percent of adults 65 and older have at least one condition, while 68% have two or more. You probably have a parent or grandparent who is managing a condition right now, or perhaps you are managing one yourself.

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732407/
> Sixty two percent of Americans over 65 have more than one chronic condition (34) and the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions is increasing (35), due to aging of populations and to increasing diabetes rates.

Heart-warming story

* https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/why-hire-a-geriatric-care-manager/
>During one especially dicey period with my mother, then in an assisted living facility, my brother and I hired a geriatric care manager, first for a consultation and then for additional help at an hourly rate. It felt like such an extravagance, given that we weren’t rolling in money, but the care manager helped solve a series of complex problems that I doubt I’d have solved by myself, mostly involving brokering a compromise with the facility, whose management wouldn’t let me hire a private aide for my mom but could not provide what she needed.

### Alice James

Very interesting views on death

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_James
>Alice James (August 7, 1848 – March 6, 1892) was an American diarist, sister of novelist Henry James and philosopher and psychologist William James. Her relationship with William was unusually close, and she seems to have been badly affected by his marriage. James suffered lifelong health problems, that were generally dismissed as hysteria, in the style of the day. She is best known for her published diaries.
