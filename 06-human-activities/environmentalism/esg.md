## SDG is good

* SDGs are quite well defined, agreed and documented
* SDGs are about results with metrics and targets
* You should be able to see results on the factory floor


## ESG is not as good

* ESG is weakly defined, a political hot potato, open to being misused in many ways.
* There is no organization or body that monitors or maintains standards
* ESG is about investing more than results
* ESG is a ploy used by public companies to look like they are being nice
* ESG is a discussion not a process
* ESG is more about reporting than acting
* There are no ESG standards, goals, metrics and targets


## ESG guides

Nonetheless, ESG is important and is still under development so here are some tips:

* Upon first use, always: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
* An executive-level person - senior VP - has ESG or compliance in their title
* "ESG" - even better: SDG - is used in a number of job descriptions throughout the organization
* Every department has ESG measurable goals, targets and metrics
* All these are also asked and designed to help profit, engagement and efficiency ~ win-win
* All of these work with standards and metrics that enable comparison with other organizations
* As much as possible, compliance and monitoring is automated. No pencils are used ever! ;-)
* "ESG" is part of manufacturing process, the design process, the hiring process and the accounting process
* Measurement stats and results are public and visible to all - even on the factory floor
* Emergencies and bad things happen. Be prepared and be prepared to mitigate ESG disasters
* Wherever possible incorporate SDGs


More
* Go open source - create THE standard for others to follow - examples Arduino * Raspberry Pi
* Remember: ESG is imaginary ~ SDG is real
* If there is a difficult certification: go for it. Certification eliminates the little guys.
* There are many ways of supporting ESGs even in daily office life - and ways of indicating compliance

  * Excellent work, hugely informative yet it makes no reference to the quality of the human rights or manufacturing process or SDG or anything like that
  * No mention of any SDGs ~ Ditto https://enviolo.com/certificates-and-patents/

Standards
* ISO4210
* EN15194


## Tests of Commitment to ESG

If an organization is truly committed to ESG success, then it must adopt at least some, relevant SDG goals.

Why?

* SDG goals have been established by expert agreement to be the most important goals in today's world
* Any goals other SDG goals must therefore be less important and therefore less worthy of effort
* SDG goals have targets and metrics - allowing for comparison between units and organizations
* Any goals other than SDG goals are unlikely to be comparable with other organizations
* Observing SDG goals gives you bragging rights that are believable
* Any internally developed goals are like to be a mystery to outsiders and difficult for outsiders to monitor and therefor less believable
