## SDG is good

* SDGs are quite well defined, agreed and documented
* SDGs are about results with metrics and targets
* You should be able to see results on the factory floor


## ESG is bad

* ESG is weakly defined, a political hot potato, open to being misused in many ways.
* There is no organization or body that monitors or maintains standards
* ESG is about investing more than results
* ESG is a ploy used by public companies to look like they are being nice
* ESG is a discussion not a process
* ESG is more about reporting than acting
* There are no ESG standards, goals, metrics and targets

## ESG guides

* Upon first use, always: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
* An exec level person has ESG or compliance in their title
* "ESG" is used in a number of job descriptions throughout
* Every department has ESG goals, target and metrics
* All these are also asked to help profit, engagement and efficiency
* All of these work with standards and metrics that enable comparison with other organizations
* As much as possible, compliance and monitoring is automated. No pencils are used ever! ;-)
* "ESG" is part of manufacturing process, the design process, the hiring process and the accounting process
* Measurement stats and results are public and visible to all - even on the factory floor
* Emergencies and bad things happen. Be prepared and be prepared to mitigate ESG disasters

More
* Go open sources - create THE standard
* Remember: ESG is bogus ~ SDG is good
* If there is a difficult certification: go for it. Certification eliminates the little guys.
* There are many ways of supporting ESGs even in daily office life - and ways of indicating compliance
