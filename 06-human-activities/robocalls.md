# What to do about "robocalls"

Notable aspects of life at the Heritage are the kindness, generosity and openness of both residents and staff. We help others. The downside is that some people may take advantage of you being so nice.  Recently I have heard the details of three scam efforts. All the scams involved unexpected phone calls. All the schemes were caught in time.

The scams all involved phone calls made by computers. We often say they are "robocalls" - calls made by robots. But "calls made by robbers" may work as well. They follow a pattern. As soon as you answer, a real human comes on the line. The caller fakes being a friend of a friend or family member. They say one of them is in trouble. There is an urgent need for money. The callers have learned all the tricks. They answer every question you ask with a logical, believable response. If you are caught off guard, you can easily be trapped into wanting to pay.

The question is: How can you protect yourself from this harm? Here are five ideas.

1. **Prevent robocalls**.  preventing the robocall from coming in. For your moble phone, you can gat an app from your phone company that blocks many robocalls. Verizon have their "Call Filter" app. AT&T have their "Mobile Security" app. These apps are free and need to be downloaded to your mobile phone.

2. ** Don't answer**. If you can, look at the phone number before you answer. If the number if from an area code you don't know, then do not answer the call. Let the call go to voice mail.
Once you listen to the voicemail, decide whether to answer or not

Answer phone calls on a device that shows you the phone number. if you don't know the number or area code do not answer.

3. Slow it down. Scammers create a sense of urgency. They bypass your better instincts.
Take your time. Ask questions. Don't be rushed into a bad situation. Say that you are busy. Ask for a number to call back

What a scammer might say:

* You need to act fast. If you don’t make a payment now, we’ll be forced to take legal action against you.
* There was a drunk-driving accident. The mother and baby are dieing.
* My phone call only last for three minutes. The lawyer will call you back
* “Grandma, I need money for bail.” Or money for a medical bill. Or some other kind of trouble.
What you can do:

* Who are you?
* What is your name? What is the name of my grand-daughter?
* What is the name of the office? What is your phone number? What is your email address?
* Can I call you back? How do I contact you?
* Ask them where you live. Try to get a fact. Let them prove they know you.


4. Ask and check. Do your research. Double check the details. If you get an unexpected phone call, hang up. Look up the bank, agency or organization the caller mentioned.  Get in touch directly.

What a scammer might say:
* This is the IRS calling. We haven’t received your tax payments for four years. That’s a federal crime.

What you can do
> Look up your grandkid’s phone number yourself, or call another family member.


5. Stop! Don't send — Reputable people or agency=ies do not demand payment on the spot. Often, scammers tell you to go buy gift cards. gift cards are to be given as a gift, not as payment under threat. If the payment feels fishy, it probably is fishy.

I have instructed my money manager: If I ever ask for to transfer a large amount of money in a hurry or to amn unusual destination that they should get in touch with one of my daughters before carrying out tge transaction

What a scammer might say:
* Please send us Amazon gift cards of $100 or $200 face value. I need 20 of each card.
* Fedex the envelope to this address. Make sure it deliver at 8:30 AM.

What you can do
* Don’t wire money or pay with a prepaid debit card
* Understand there are few emergencies. Even fewer where people cannot take care of themselves.
* Never send money to a stranger.
* Talk to a relative or financial manager and let them deal with it.
