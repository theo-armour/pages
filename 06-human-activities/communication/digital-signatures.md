>The general intent of the ESIGN Act is spelled out in the first section (101.a), that a contract or signature “may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form”. This simple statement provides that electronic signatures and records are just as good as their paper equivalents, and therefore subject to the same legal scrutiny of authenticity that applies to paper documents.

>(c) If a law requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law.
>(d) If a law requires a signature, an electronic signature satisfies the law.

> The Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA) provides that "signatures" made via electronic means will be legally binding just as hand-written signatures now are. The law also enhances and clarifies the authority of government to create and retain records in computer produced electronic form. There is now no doubt that electronic records have the same legal force as those produced in other formats such as paper and microfilm.

> § 304. Use of electronic signatures.
> 2. In accordance with this section unless specifically provided otherwise by law, an electronic signature may be used by a person in lieu of a signature affixed by hand. The use of an electronic signature shall have the same validity and effect as the use of a signature affixed by hand.
