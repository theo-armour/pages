Overall Framework for US Politics

Normal politics
* Not attentive or mobilized
* Generally Partisan ~ follow leaders ~ follow parents
* No indifferent to Public Good but Focused on self-interest

Intermittent Episodes
* Understand Constitutional issues
* Change political motivations / more deliberate / public-spirited
* Takes decades

If there's a chance to focus on deeper questions: we are at the moment
