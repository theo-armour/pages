# Theo to Jose

## External links are the windows to the world

My Amazon fridge magnet reminds me from time to time: _A room without books is like a body without a soul._ &ndash;attributed to [Marcus Aurelius Cicero] ( https://sites.la.utexas.edu/cicero/myths/ )

I think must live in a nearly soul-less reality because I have found new homes for nearly all my books. On the other hand, the Amazon Kindle App means I can I can bring a library of books even into a moving room (an elevator) &mdash; virtually.

Thinking of virtual worlds, a web page without external links is like a room without windows. Internal linlkks are the doors that enable you to proceed from page to page - from room to room so to speak - but the links to other web sites provide the landscape for the discussion. By looking out the windows we frame the discussion, we observe collaboration and confrontation.

Jose I hope your discussion paper grows, gets more detail and gets better. In doing so you might consider adding links to URLs that share your dreams and aspirations.

## stand on the shoulders of giants

_"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants._

Saint Paul's School asks us to be "scholar athletes". Well, athletes play in teams and cohorts and scholars build upon the work of the scholars they study. The team photo and the list of footnotes are indicators

Both endeavors are seem as collaborations with others and with history.

Jose, the ideas you wish promote most all have histories. And some a new that you have discovered or invented.

I hope your discussion paper grows, gets more detail and gets better. In doing so you might consider adding links to available sources for what you report and promote.

## Win-Win ~ A single candle that is lit may be use to enlighten many 

In a previous message, I wrote about Saint Paul's School as being "A city on the hill" - which is from quotation with a long history - used by both the right and left.

How could this be engineered, envisioned and encouraged?
