As provided assistance to many different groups of San Franciscans across multiple generations
 In the early 1920’s, the government mandated foster care as the preferred choice for children, and unfortunately, the “Ark” closed down. However, the need to care for San Francisco’s elderly women had now become more important than ever. In 1922, The Heritage’s current land site was donated by a generous benefactor, after the then-empty block within the Marina District had been used as part of the extended site of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Julia Morgan, the first female architect in San Francisco, renowned for her work on the Hearst Castle, the Fairmont Hotel, Mills College and many other projects, was enlisted to design a home of elegance and stature to provide convalescent care to the City’s elderly women. When it was completed in 1925. Sisters Edith and Lucy Allyne, direct descendants of local pioneers, donated half the funds to purchase apartments on adjoining properties to house members of the home’s staff.

> The Heritage (1924-1925)
The Ladies Protection and Relief Society of San Francisco established The Heritage as high-quality housing and nursing care for senior citizens in 1924, and today it still functions as such. Constructed from reinforced concrete and faced with brick, this building was carefully designed by Morgan to withstand an earthquake since it was sited on landfill from the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition.
