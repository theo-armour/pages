The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, doing business as "Heritage on the Marina", is a non-profit foundation that operates a retirement community in the [[Marina_District,_San_Francisco|Marina District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Founded in 1853 with the mission "to render protection and assistance to strangers, to sick independent women and children," the organization has provided a variety of philanthropic benefits to generations of San Franciscans. Currently providing four levels of care ([[independent living]], [[assisted-living]], [[memory-care]], and [[Nursing_home|skilled nursing]], the current plan envisages transitioning to an [[aging-in-place]] model. The current premises are of historical and architectural merit and were designed by architect [[Julia Morgan]] in 1923.

1863 The Society established a home for women and children needing shelter on undeveloped land bordered by Van Ness, Geary, Franklin and Post street donated by Horace Hawes. The Franklin Street building was known as the "Old Brown Ark" and was primarily used as an orphanage but also housed indigent mothers and elderly women.<ref name="highlights 2012">{{cite web |title=The Heritage ~ Highlights 2012 |url=http://www.zeimer.com/wp-content/uploads/006-TH-AnlRpt_22x17_03lr.pdf |website=Freelance Copywriter: Gil Zeimer |publisher=San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society |access-date=2023-02-08}}</ref>

== Premises ==

=== Heritage on the Marina ( 1925 to Present) ===
[[File:2020-08-20-front-facade.jpg|thumb|left|Heritage on the Marina at 3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco CA 94123 designed by Julia Morgan|thumb|alt=Building in the Tudor style|Heritage on the Marina at 3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco CA 94123 designed by Julia Morgan]]

In the early 1920’s, the government mandated foster care as the preferred choice for children, and unfortunately, the “Ark” closed down. However, the need to care for San Francisco’s elderly women had now become more important than ever. In 1922, Heritage’s current land site was donated by a generous benefactor, after the then-empty block within the Marina District - a property bounded by Francisco, Bay, Laguna and Octavia Streets - had been used as part of the extended site of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition.

Julia Morgan, the first female architect in San Francisco, renowned for her work on the Hearst Castle, the Fairmont Hotel, Mills College and many other projects, was enlisted to design a home of elegance and stature to provide convalescent care to the City’s elderly women. When it was completed in 1925. Sisters Edith and Lucy Allyne, direct descendants of local pioneers, donated half the funds to purchase apartments on adjoining properties to house members of the home’s staff.

=== Crocker Old People's Home ( 1884 to 1957 )===

[[File:1899-san-francisco-crocker-old-peoples-home-exterior.png|thumb|left|The Crocker Old People's Home, exterior]] [[File:1899-san-francisco-crocker-old-peoples-home-interior.png|thumb|left|The Crocker Old People's Home, interior]]

[[Mary Ann Deming Crocker]] (1827-1889) commissioned prominent 19th-century architect [[A. Page Brown]] (1859-1896) to design a mausoleum at [[Mountain_View_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California)|Mountain View Cemetery]] for her deceased husband, the railroad mogul [[Charles Crocker]] (1822-1888), and an Old People's Home for a site at 2507 Pine Street in Lower Pacific Heights. The noted Bay Area architect, [[Willis Polk]] (1867-1924), also came to San Francisco, CA, to work for Brown on these two formative commissions.

This was an early and creative example of housing for the elderly. The construction of the old people's home comprised a ground floor of San Jose brick, which supported two and one half stories of wood frame structure sheathed in redwood shingles laid in straight courses.

The Home was originally four stories high, with a complex shingled hip roof with flared edges, multiple dormers and pointed turrets. The rhythmic curving bays with patterned shingles and arched 1st floor windows enliven the street facades. The corner entrance is impressive in its subtle detail and restraint, allowing it to blend with residential surroundings.

Shingles are used to create alternating lozenge and diamond patterns (partially intact) that filled the surface between the 2nd and 3rd stories. The l-plan building extends along Pine and Pierce streets; circular bays at the corner and the western end of the building (now lost) extended to a height of 75 feet, including the tops of the conical towers.

Hipped roofs and dormers further contributed to the picturesque silhouette of the building. The effect of the building's undulating wall, contained at the roof by the skin-like membrane of irregularly laid redwood shingles, was described at the time as "producing the much admired effects of the old roof seen in Brittany".

This building still exists in San Francisco, CA, known as the "Rose Court."

In 1957 the Crocker Old People's Home merged with the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society. That November, sixty-seven former residents of 2507 Pine Street moved to 3400 Laguna.


=== The "Old Brown Ark" (1863 to 1925 )===
[[File:1866-sflpars-old-brown-ark-west.jpg|thumb|left|1866 The "Old Brown Ark", San Francisco, West Side]]

The premises of the first dedicated care home of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society from 1863 to 1925 were situated between Van Ness, Franklin, Geary and Post Streets on land donated by [[Horace May Hawes]]. Designed by [[S. C. Bugbee & Son]]. The Franklin Street house, which came to be known affectionately as the “Old Brown Ark”, was primarily used as an orphanage but also housed indigent mothers and elderly women. A new wing was added in 1898. Now the site of the [[California_Pacific_Medical_Center]]
