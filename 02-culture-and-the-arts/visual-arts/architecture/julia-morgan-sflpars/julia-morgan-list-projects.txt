Berkeley City Club
The Berkeley City Clubwas commissioned as the club house of the Berkeley Women's City Club organized in Berkeley, California in 1927 to contribute to social, civic, and cultural progress. This private club is no longer restricted to women, and the club house building is available to the public at large for overnight stays, weddings and other occasions. The building, constructed in 1929, is one of the outstanding works of noted California architect Julia Morgan. The San Francisco-born Morgan was the first woman to gain admission and earn a certificate from the Ecole de Beaux-Arts in Paris and the first licensed female architect in California. She designed over 100 women's organization... more on Wikipedia

Chapel of the Chimes
Chapel of the Chimes was founded in 1909 as a crematory and columbarium in Oakland, California.

Julia Morgan Theater
Renowned architect Julia Morgan designed this building in 1908 as the St. John's Presbyterian Church. Her designs included the church and adjacent Sunday School classroom space. Working with a budget of two dollars per square foot, Morgan used natural redwood paneling, once affordable and abundant, for the interior and exterior of the building. On the inside she left exposed wooden beams, supports, nuts and bolts as part of the design. The result was an inexpensive, functional but very beautiful building.From http://www.juliamorgan.org/building.shtml... more on Wikipedia
