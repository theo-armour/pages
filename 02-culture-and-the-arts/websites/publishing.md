# Publishing Websites

2026-01-18 Hi Jackson

Yes, subscribing to Medium for $5/month is probably a good idea. But I wonder, do they have a student price?

Remember, rising above the level of AI slop is the challenge.

Finding writers you like

* Click on the search icon, then on "Explore topics"
* https://medium.com/explore-topics
* https://medium.com/tag/politics

Look for publications you might like to write for (after you have a bunch of posts to show)

* https://medium.com/reimagining-the-civic-commons
* https://medium.com/data-science-collective

Some tips

* Use "I", Talk about yourself, talk about your efforts, talk about what you're trying to accomplish.
* Include links. A web page without links is like a room without a window.
* Include a nice image of the post at the top
* Include tags, so you can be found.
* Publish on Medium and then link to the post from X and LinkedIn and wherever else you hang out online.
