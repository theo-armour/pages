Why:

* Only the rich can afford to learn Greek
* Discusses things that you mustn't discuss in public
* Facilitates the discussion of taboo subjects using a common but rare language only the rich and powerful can understand


## Teaches the skills required to be a leader

* "Use the rage (menin), Achilles"
* Be patriarchal, male-dominated, misogynistic
* Be tricky, lie, deceive, cheat, steal, kill. It's OK to kill your enemies

* Ultimately it's all about beauty, and the pursuit of beauty. Very weird.

* know their assets and liabilities
* know their home bases
* know the names of their primary subordinates
* Know the number ships ~ knowing the number of ships tells you how many men they can field
* And, very important, know each one by name

* Mothers are your go-betweens; will intercede on your behalf better than you can
* Use your mother to your advantage

* Anything goes


## People outside your network but inside your culture

* You can trust them, and you can lie to them

## Clothes make the man
