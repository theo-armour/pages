# Code Mission and Vision



## Mission

<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_
[A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment,
and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

Patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that
can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

* To help people get into science, technology, engineering and math ([STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics ) )
* To supply scripts that are useful, written in code that is simple to understand
* To help designers, engineers, scientists - non-programmers - create new types of domain-specific apps
* To utilize the new technologies being made available in browsers to create new visual and aural interactions
* To supply all code as free open source software( [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) )
* To visualize everything in 3D


### [STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics ) is at the root

* Emphasis on astronomy, physics, math but not coding
* To provide software examples that only require a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to get going and 'make it your own'
* To demonstrate that all this is possible in an environment that allows you to fork, embellish, share and publish online that is free and open source
* Seek great visualizations not great code
* The code is not there to impress programmers or to show off programming skills
	* Unless that skill is about making code simpler and easier to digest
* The code must be easy to read so that the physics, math, engineering or whatever stands out not the techie bits
* Typically you are looking at two screens or windows - one showing the simulation and the other showing the code
	* The task is to reduce the multi-tasking to a minimum


### Fork, edit and share

* The mantra: fork a copy, edit and improve, then share
* You should be able to download or copy a folder to your computer and it should just run
* Download it. click on it - and it just runs
* Sharing is of the essence


### Written for speedy, meaningful reading

The code should be as close as possible to readable - or even spoken - English

* Supply a range of cookbook code samples only a few hundred lines long that beginners can learn in an afternoon and begin enhancing in a day or two.
* Follow established coding - not too quirky - standards so that students coming in get up to speed quickly
* In other words it's great if you can read the code out load and it means something
* It should only take you a few minutes to get the idea of what the code does and how it works
* Lots of small apps
	* Not one big app


### Patterns Everywhere

* Everything you need to know about a script is in one place and written in the same way.
* Everything is in between two `<script>` tags and written in JavaScript
* Even the HTML and CSS is created and edited using JavaScript

### 3D is not 2D

* [_Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland )
* [_Flatland - The Movie_]( http://www.flatlandthemovie.com/ )

## Vision

<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Fabricate free, fast and fun fantasies
* Write code you can fork, edit and share
* Build engineering tools you can understand
* Become a STEM guru
* Develop skills you can use everywhere
* If the mundane engineering tasks become easy, inexpensive and swift to carry out,
then possibilities arise for the more complex, sophisticated and even extravagant ideas to turn into realities
* So much of what people do is informed by the tradition of paper. Let's disrupt some of those notions
* Let's make magic happen - and also know what's happening behind the curtain << AC Clarke tech = magic
* To help you write code that helps you - and others - to discover new things about the the universe you live in
* Enable and to attract more people into thinking about and acting on STEM issues
	* Works - eventually - on devices normally used by general populations - ie tablets and phones
	* Enables ordinary people not just to view but to interact with 3D models in new ways
	* FOSS benefits
* Help STEM professionals communicate their specialist skills to a broader population
	* No attempt to compete with the tools professionals use to tackle sophisticated and complex designs
	* Very much attempting to bring engineering and design _savoire faire_ - both high end levels and plain old common sense levels - to a broader swathe of humanity
* Perhaps a 'turntable' or mixing studio for 3D DJs
* Follow Mr.doobs' manifesto: 'to create a lightweight 3D library with a very low level of complexity — in other words, for dummies'
	* Code is designed to be very fast to read
		* Encourages engineers, scientists and non-professional programmers to add features
		* Allows designers to concentrate on improving the design rather than fixing the code
		* No need to know jQuery, Backbone, Angular. Get going if you only know a tiny bit of JavaScript
		* If you do know jQuery etc: you are welcome! Viewer code can be embedded easily in your apps
* RIP [Zaha Hadid]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaha_Hadid ). Let us continue to design with your disruptive yet aways elegant spirit

## Features

Generally the scripts are:

* Free and open source
* Built using entry level JavaScript with no dependencies other than the [Three.js]( https://threejs.org) JavaScript library
* 3D views enable you to rotate and pan using one three fingers or left button, scroll wheel and right button on a mouse.

## FAQ

#### _What does it all mean?_

There are no black boxes - with things in other places - that you never look at.

Instead of a huge file of opaque CSS rules that are mostly never invoked, there's half a dozen rules just for the script in play.
