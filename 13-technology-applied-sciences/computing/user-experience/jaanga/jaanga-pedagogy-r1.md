Jaanga Pedagogy
===


[Pedagogy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy ) is the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.

The intent of this web site is to help you teach yourself topics/concepts in STEM by visualizing and editing 
the data and code that represent an underlying theoretical concept.

By playing and manipulating the concept you become intimate with its nuances.

### Source Code Visible and Editable

Source code is not magic. Source code is something you edit.
Every project should make at least some of its source code visible and editable by the user on the spot.



### Things to Do Sections
Every script should have a 'things to do' sections relating to the issues addressed in the concept/mission/vision statement.

There should be items relating to:

* STEM
* Current mission
* Coding
* User experience

Items in things to do sections may range from simple suggestions as to fun places to tweak the code to far-ranging project road-map considerations.

As much as possible the project itself should make you as 'who, what, when, where and why?'.
The things to do are just replications of the thoughts you are being provoked by the project while you are looking at the project.

Examples:

* Was that crack in the ground made by water? I don't see any water, but that looks like water erosion to me.
* Was that crack in the ground made by an earthquake? It seems to break through hills and valleys.

 

### Reduction of the Barriers of Notation

Mathematics notation, much like music notation in music, is a barrier that hampers entry by ordinary people into mathematics.

This web site explores ways of seeing concepts in multi-faceted manners. 

You can experience a concept by

* Viewing the math notation
* Seeing a visualization
* Editing the code
* Reading descriptions


### A map is not the territory

Much of what we do here is about data visualization - looking at numbers and trying to find meaning from them. 
The use of the numbers to recreate a photographic representation of an object is but one use for that data.
Often it is not an important use...

### Fork, Edit and Share

* For - to beg, borrow or steal a concept
* Edit - to make it your own
* Share - to give back to the world

### FOSS

[Free open source software (FOSS)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) is of the essence in the future of pedagogy.


### GitHub

An example of an excellent pedagogical playground.
