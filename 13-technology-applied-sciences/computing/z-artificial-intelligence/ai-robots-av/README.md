## 2023-08-19 Current state of real world robotics

In a recent discussion with a friend, my friend indicated that robotics is currently a machine learning programming task the AI has not been able to "conquer".

Here is a "handy" link that concurs with the unconquorable:

### Hands of Gods

* https://woodfromeden.substack.com/p/hands-of-gods

> The superiority of human dexterity will not disappear anytime soon. One day robots might equal humans in physical ability. But this day is not today. It is not tomorrow either. The time when robots will outdo humans physically is probably more centuries than decades away, if it ever comes.

But:

The following two links were my wake-up call in multiple ways.

The first is that you associate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) with the current state of robots you may be beginning to enter a new era of robotics

The second wake-up was that if GAI can disrupt a discipline already as well-resourced and as well studied as robotics, then it can really disrupt most anything.


### Aided by A.I. Language Models, Google’s Robots Are Getting Smart
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/technology/google-robots-ai.html

>But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models — the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.
>
>Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.


### Google Research, 2022 & beyond: Robotics

* https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/google-research-2022-beyond-robotics.html

>In 2022, we focused on challenges that come with enabling robots to be more helpful to people: 1) allowing robots and humans to communicate more efficiently and naturally; 2) enabling robots to understand and apply common sense knowledge in real-world situations; and 3) scaling the number of low-level skills robots need to effectively perform tasks in unstructured environments.
>
>An undercurrent this past year has been the exploration of how large, generalist models, like PaLM, can work alongside other approaches to surface capabilities allowing robots to learn from a breadth of human knowledge and allowing people to engage with robots more naturally. As we do this, we’re transforming robot learning into a scalable data problem so that we can scale learning of generalized low-level skills, like manipulation.


### Is LLMs and Robotics a Hype Cycle or a true Disruption?

A good way of noting if a topic is trending "organically" rather via excessive hyping is to gauge the number of technical papers being published that relate to the topic. if so, frequently there is an "awesome list" on the topic hosted on GitHub. In this case: Bingo! Two hits:


### Awesome-LLM-Robotics

* https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Awesome-LLM-Robotics#reasoning


### Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics

* https://github.com/jrin771/Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics

It appears that the topic is being hit hard by coders looking for their $900K salaries.

But please note that all the papers I have looked at so far have multiple authors indicating good collaboration and arxiv as the host indicating reasonable corroboration.


### Current state of real world robotics

Having lots of scientific papers is one thing, but what is the current state of real world robotics? Below are links to two articles that give a good overview of the current state of LLMs and robotics.

### The Future of Recycling Is Sorty McSortface

> It’s really hard to sort all the junk that gets thrown in recycling bins. Do tech start-ups have the answer?

* https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/ai-recycling-bots/675037/

> AI stands to change that calculus, giving recycling plants a far more granular view into packaging that otherwise tends to be hopelessly commingled. These recycling bots—from Amp and competitors such as MachineX, Bulk Handling Systems, Glacier Robotics, and Everest Labs—are “vision systems”: In the same way that ChatGPT is trained by ingesting text that has been published online, they absorb lots of photographs of tossed-out items in various states of degradation and disrepair. The robots are then able to identify even tiny differences in a product’s color, shape, texture, or logo—and in the case of Amp, even its SKU, the unique number manufacturers assign to each kind of item they sell, Matanya Horowitz, Amp’s CEO, told me.

### RoboAgent

>Towards Sample Efficient Robot Manipulation with Semantic Augmentations and Action Chunking

* https://robopen.github.io/

>RoboAgent is a convergence of multiple research thread (GenAug, CACTI, ACT) spanning two years, and a starting point at the same time for many more future research directions. During the course of its developments we have also been heavily inspired by and have learned a lot from many recent generalizable robot learning projects. For further reading in this space, refer to -- RT-1 (and much more recent RT-2) which studies generalization in robot learning at scale with large demonstration dataset in association with large language models. Differently, RoboCat uses an iterative learning and data-generalization pipeline for fast adaptation.

### Conclusions

I am not sure if the current state of robotics is a hype cycle or a true disruption. But I am sure that the current state of robotics is a lot more advanced than I had thought.
