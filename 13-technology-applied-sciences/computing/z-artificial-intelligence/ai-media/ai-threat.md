### One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100)

The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, or AI100, is a 100-year effort to study and anticipate how the effects of artificial intelligence will ripple through every aspect of how people work, live and play. It was launched in the fall of 2014 with a grant from the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation, which will provide $10 million over the first five years. Inspired by the 1949 landmark study, “Toward a Mechanized Mathematics,” which was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the AI100 is hosted by Stanford University and housed at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

As AI systems prove to be increasingly beneficial in real-world applications, they have broadened their reach, causing risks of misuse, overuse, and explicit abuse to proliferate. As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning.1 New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily misspecified, objectives.2 A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.

* Techno-Solutionism
* Dangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice
* Disinformation and Threat to Democracy
* Discrimination and Risk in the Medical Setting
