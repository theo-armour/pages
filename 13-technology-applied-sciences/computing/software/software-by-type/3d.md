## NerfStudio API

* https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/index.html
>Nerfstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and visualizing NeRFs. The library supports an interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component. With modular NeRF components, we hope to create a user-friendly experience in exploring the technology. Nerfstudio is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can easily build upon each other’s contributions.
