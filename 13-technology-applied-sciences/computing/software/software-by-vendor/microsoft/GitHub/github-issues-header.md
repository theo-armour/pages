# Ladybug Tools/Spider

Spider helps you with building your presence on the Web. Spiders are good with webs, you know. The web presence Spider wants to help you build is your building presentation web presence. Yup, most often the spider webs are in the building, but here the buildings are in the web. I'm getting confused too. Maybe I'll just look at the pictures.

Earlier versions of the scripts are at [Ladybug Web]( http://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug-web/ ) and at [ibpsa2017.github.io]( https://ibpsa2017.github.io/ ).

There's more background in the [Read Me file]( file:///d%3A/Dropbox/Public/git-repos/ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/index.html#README.md).
