In a recent discussion with a friend, my friend indicated that robotics is currently a machine learning programming task the AI has not been able to "conquor".

Here is a handy link that concurs with the unconquorable:

### Hands of Gods

> The superiority of human dexterity will not disappear anytime soon. One day robots might equal humans in physical ability. But this day is not today. It is not tomorrow either. The time when robots will outdo humans physically is probably more centuries than decades away, if it ever comes.

But:

The following two links were my wakeup call in multiple ways: If Generative AI can change robotics overnight, then it can really change things.


### Aided by A.I. Language Models, Google’s Robots Are Getting Smart
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/technology/google-robots-ai.html


### Google Research, 2022 & beyond: Robotics

* https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/google-research-2022-beyond-robotics.html

A good way of noting if a topic is trending "organically" rather via excessive hyping is to guage the number of technical papers being published that relae to the topic. if so, frequently there is an "awesome list" on the topic hosted on GitHub. In this case: Bingo! Two hits:


### Awesome-LLM-Robotics

* https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Awesome-LLM-Robotics#reasoning

### Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics

* https://github.com/jrin771/Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics

It appears that the topic is being hit hard by coders looking for their $900K salaries.

But please note that all the papes I have looked at so far have multiple authors indicating good collabortion and arxiv as the host indicating reasonable corraboration.
