>AI may be on its way to outcompete human brains. But humans’ real strength might be somewhere else entirely.

>While AI has been able to leapfrog human brains by doing things the brains were not primarily made for doing, this kind of leapfrogging is not possible with most other parts of the human body. This is why human eyes and ears are still very much competitive with the best cameras and microphones. It is also why those robotic hands look so clunky and fumbling compared to human hands.

>The robots of yesteryear did cause alarm, just like AI causes alarm today. But not really in the same way. Robots were manual workers, the equivalent of the human working class. And what people expect from deviant working class is violent outbursts and wanton destruction. Consequently, robots were primarily seen as a threat to humans physical safety.

>The introduction of AI will have profound effects on the global economy. But it will most probably not have very much effect on global humanity. At least not the way it plays out in the minds of the AI alarmists where AI is a threat to the very existence of humanity.

>The superiority of human dexterity will not disappear anytime soon. One day robots might equal humans in physical ability. But this day is not today. It is not tomorrow either. _The time when robots will outdo humans physically is probably more centuries than decades away, if it ever comes._

### Who's in charge?

>The world is composed of leaders and followers, bosses and workers. Nominally the bosses are in charge and decide what the workers should do. But this only works as long as the workers actually follow the orders the bosses give them. At every given moment the followers have the ability to stop following the leaders.

>AI alarmists seem to believe that AI will surpass humans in persuasive skill by a significant margin. Maybe they are right, maybe not. I do not think it matters very much in practice. Humans are used to being subject to persuasion. Significant resources are invested in persuading us to do things (advertising, politics, etc). Most of it is simply ignored. An AI that gave orders to destroy the world would most probably be ignored as well.


### The bane of the bullshitting class

>Phrased differently, since AI is a world-beating producer of bullshit, it will simply saturate the world with bullshit and all those who did bullshitting for a living will find themselves out of work and out of social position. AI might not be an existential threat to humanity but it is definitely an existential threat to the bullshitting class.

### Humans of the world, unite! #1

>It could be a match made in heaven. AI is a great administrator but has no abilities to handle things in the physical world. Manual workers are great at handling physical objects but have limited capacity, or willingness, to deal with organization and administration. Together they can do great things.

>Just like household appliances freed the professional class from domestic servants, AI may free the working class from middle managers. AI alarmists warn that AI will become our sinister overlords. For a significant part of the population this warning has no credibility. For the simple reason that they already have sinister overlords. For them, AI is not a threat so much as an opportunity. An opportunity to break free from the overlords and finally manage their own affairs.

Gotta hand it to you! You have a fresh perspective on AGI. Your fingers are pointing in directions outside the frame the mainstream media points to!

Nonetheless I'd like to push back a bit on a few of your thoughts.

### Dexterity

>The superiority of human dexterity will not disappear anytime soon. One day robots might equal humans in physical ability. But this day is not today. It is not tomorrow either. _The time when robots will outdo humans physically is probably more centuries than decades away, if it ever comes._

I am reminded of the quote apocryphally attributed to Henry Ford: "If I had asked my customers what they wanted they would have said a faster horse”.

In other words, what happens when AI - as Ford did - changes the rules? For example, suppose AI enables better "just-in-time growing" where little robos bring ripe food from farm to your kitchen? No warehouse needed. Or bricks from the kiln directly to the building site? No hands needed!

With actions like these the need for human dexterity is reduced. Thus, I've have no feeling that "disarming" society will take centuries.

### A disarming experience

What happens when AI changes the rules. Suppose AI enables better "just-in-time growing" where little robos bring ripe food from farm to yur kitchen? Or bricks from the kiln directly to the web site? No hands needed!

I've have no feeling that this will take centuries
