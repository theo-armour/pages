The following  two pages were my wakeup call: If Generative AI can change robotics overnight, then it can really change things.


### Aided by A.I. Language Models, Google’s Robots Are Getting Smart
* https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/technology/google-robots-ai.html


### Google Research, 2022 & beyond: Robotics

* https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/google-research-2022-beyond-robotics.html


A good way of noting if a topic is trending "organically" rather via excessive hyping is to guage the number of technical papers being published that relae to the topic. if so, frequently there is an "awesome list" on the topic hosted on GitHub. In this case: Bingo! Two hits:

#### Awesome-LLM-Robotics

* https://github.com/GT-RIPL/Awesome-LLM-Robotics#reasoning

### Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics

* https://github.com/jrin771/Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics
