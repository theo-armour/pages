What would you enter as a text prompt for DALL-E 2?
As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to enter text prompts for DALL-E 2 myself, as it is a separate machine learning model developed by OpenAI. However, if you're looking for a prompt to use with DALL-E 2, you could try something like:

"Create an image of a fantastical cityscape with towering skyscrapers made entirely out of plants and flowers."

or

"Generate a picture of a giant squid wearing a top hat and holding a cane, surrounded by a group of curious onlookers."

Remember that DALL-E 2 is designed to create images based on text descriptions, so the more detailed and specific your prompt is, the better chance you have of getting a satisfying result.
