### Upload an image to Discord
To upload an image, click the Plus sign next to where messages are typed. Select Upload a File, select an image, and send the message. To add this image to a prompt, begin typing /imagine as usual. After the prompt box appears, drag the image file into the prompt box to add the image's URL. Alternatively, right-click the image, select Copy Link, and then paste the link within the prompt box.

## Parameters

Aspect Ratios
--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

Chaos
--chaos <number 0‚Äì100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

No
--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

Quality
--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.

Seed
--seed <integer between 0‚Äì4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or
--sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

Stop
--stop <integer between 10‚Äì100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Style
--style <4a, 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4

Stylize
--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs. default value is 100 and accepts integer values 0‚Äì1000

Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta
--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.


### Model Version Parameters

Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.

Niji
--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.

High Definition
--hd Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.

Test
--test Use the Midjourney special test model.

Testp
--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.

Version
--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.

### How to Find a Job's Seed Number

### Upscaler Parameters

Midjourney starts by generating a grid of low-resolution image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any grid image to increase the size and add additional details. There are multiple upscale models available for upscaling an image.

Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta
--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Upanime
Use an alternative upscaler trained to work with the when selecting the U buttons. This upscaler was specifically created to work with the --niji Midjourney Model.


### Other Parameters
These parameters only work with specific earlier Midjourney Models

Creative
--creative Modify the test and testp models to be more varied and creative.

Image Weight
--iw Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is --iw 0.25.

Sameseed
--sameseed Seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. When --sameseed is specified, all images in the initial grid use the same starting noise and will produce very similar generated images.

Video
--video Saves a progress video of the initial image grid being generated. Emoji react to the completed image grid with ‚úâÔ∏è to trigger the video being sent to your direct messages. --video does not work when upscaling an image.
