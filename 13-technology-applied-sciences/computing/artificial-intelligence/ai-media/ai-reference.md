## Glossary

Every AI glossary has a different list of terms. Each one has its own point of view. It is fun to go through several lists and compare the differences in the outlook.

### Timelines

Every AI timeline seemed to have different events listed. I found it interesting to compare the differences.

## Curated list of AI terms

A list of AI terms I started

* AI buzzwords include LLM, PaLM and GPT-3.
* Synthography ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthography
* AFI stands for artificial general intelligence.
* LLM stands for large language model.
* PaLM stands for paraphrase language model.
* GPT-3 stands for generative pre-trained transformer
* RCI stands for recursive conditional inference
* SOTA stands for state of the art
* Ablation ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_(artificial_intelligence)
* LLaMa stands for large language model of the arts

I expect that every specific endeavor into AI will require its own glossary and timeline.


### AGI Artificial general intelligence

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence
> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can

## Diffusion model

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model

>In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models, are a class of latent variable models. They are Markov chains trained using variational inference. The goal of diffusion models is to learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space. In computer vision, this means that a neural network is trained to denoise images blurred with Gaussian noise by learning to reverse the diffusion process.[2][3] Three examples of generic diffusion modeling frameworks used in computer vision are denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations.

>Image generation can be done in numerous ways, but by far the most successful as of today is diffusion, which is the technique at the heart of Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and other popular generative AIs. **Diffusion models are trained by showing them images that are gradually degraded by adding digital noise until there is nothing left of the original. By observing this, diffusion models learn to do the process in reverse as well, gradually adding detail to pure noise in order to form an arbitrarily defined image.** We’re already starting to move beyond this for images, but the technique is reliable and relatively well understood, so don’t expect it to disappear any time soon.


## Foundation Models

* GTP-4. Bard

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models

* A foundation model is a large artificial intelligence model trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data at scale (usually by self-supervised learning) resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.
* Foundation models are behind a major transformation in how AI systems are built since their introduction in 2018.
* Early examples of foundation models were large pre-trained language models including BERT and GPT-3.
* Subsequently, several multimodal foundation models have been produced including DALL-E, Flamingo, and Florence.
* The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) popularized the term.

## Generative artificial intelligence

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence

>Generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data, and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.

## Neural Network

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network

>A neural network can refer to either a neural circuit of biological neurons (sometimes also called a biological neural network), or a network of artificial neurons or nodes in the case of an artificial neural network.[1] Artificial neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems
