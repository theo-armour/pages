* Simple prompts do better. Start your prompts with "logo design for..." and go from there.
* Text doesn't work great yet in Midjourney, but if you know how to use Photoshop or free alternatives like Photopea or Canva, you can easily replace the text with your own.
* Use designers & artists in your prompts who are good at the style you are looking for. Here's a list of well known graphic designers and artists to get you started.
