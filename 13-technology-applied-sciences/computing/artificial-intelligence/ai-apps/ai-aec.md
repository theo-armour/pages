# Theo ~ AI AEC Read Me

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)

A first pass at checking out the AI scene in AEC.

For AEC matters that are not AI related, see the [AEC Read Me](https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#13-technology-applied-sciences/architecture/README.md ).

This Read Me is intended be read in conjunction with:

* https://raindrop.io/TheoA/ai-aec-35784921/sort=title


## AI AEC Sites of interest

The following six categories of types of links are a first pass. These categories will be refined over time.

It mey be better to have Read Me diles for each category. For now, they are all in this one file.

## Articles

Links to articles culled from regularly published AEC sources.

This category includes articles that discuss things such

* The possible uses of AI in AEC
* Lists of projects to watch
* Prompt suggestions relating to AEC

### Agenda

* Now we know the AEC publishers we can start to look for articles
* The we can gauge the quality of the articles and select the best ones

## Design

Links to AI sites that assist with design in architecture. They include sites that cover topics such as these:

* BIM process
* Design-Build
* Design optimization
* Early stage design
* Feasibility studies
* Generative design
* Optimized floor plans
* Real time design of buildings
* Space planning
* Speech to text to design
* Virtual design and construction (VDC)

### Agenda

* Begin to gauge the quality of the offerings


A selection of Design links:

### Architext

* https://architext.ai/

Streamline your architectural design process

Instantly turn natural language into full-featured layouts with APIs and plugins

### Finch3D

* https://www.finch3d.com/

Your design, optimized

* Scheduling
* Structural
* Urban planning

A selection of Workflow links:

### Alice Technologies

* https://www.alicetechnologies.com/

Plan faster and smarter

Upload a 3D model to ALICE and quickly create a buildable 4D schedule. No BIM model? No problem. ALICE also works with simple block diagrams.

Add transparency to your planning process by connecting your design with your schedule and estimates to visualize all aspects of your construction project.

### APE Mobile

* https://www.apemobile.com/
* https://damstratechnology.com/

Samm (APE Mobile) is a site intelligence platform for excellence in construction.

Construction companies rely on our mobile and web application to capture and manage site-related data in real time. This enables everyone in the field and in the office to know what’s going on, make better decisions and get more done. Reduce rework. Be more productive. Achieve construction excellence.

### Augmenta

* https://augmenta.ai/
