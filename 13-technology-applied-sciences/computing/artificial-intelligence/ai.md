https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models

* A foundation model is a large artificial intelligence model trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data at scale (usually by self-supervised learning) resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.
* Foundation models are behind a major transformation in how AI systems are built since their introduction in 2018.
* Early examples of foundation models were large pre-trained language models including BERT and GPT-3.
* Subsequently, several multimodal foundation models have been produced including DALL-E, Flamingo, and Florence.
* The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) popularized the term.
