## Overview

MSLA (Masked Stereolithography Apparatus) 3D printing uses a powerful UV LED light source projected through an LCD screen to simultaneously cure entire layers of liquid resin, forming a three-dimensional object with each lift of the build plate. This process is considerably faster than traditional SLA, which traces layers point-by-point with a laser, and it produces highly detailed prints with smooth surfaces. The resolution of MSLA prints is determined by the LCD’s pixel size, making it ideal for projects that require fine finish and precision.

The benefits of MSLA 3D printing over other 3D printing methods include:

- Significantly faster print times, since entire layers are cured at once instead of tracing with a laser or extruder.[1][2][7]
- Outstanding surface smoothness and fine detail, making it ideal for miniatures, dental models, and jewelry.[2][3][7]
- More efficient for batch production, as printing several objects takes no longer than printing just one on the same build platform.[7][1]
- Generally lower hardware and maintenance costs compared to DLP or industrial SLA systems, making it accessible to hobbyists and small businesses.[3][7]
- Simpler operation and user interfaces, helping even beginners achieve professional results with minimal setup.[7]

**PhotSynth: Precision MSLA Printing Meets Full-Color and Multi-Material Innovation**

* _Step into the future with the first MSLA printer that combines speed, detail, and brilliant color._

While current MSLA 3D printers offer high detail and speed, they also have a distinct disadvantages compared to other 3D printing methods:

Unless there is significant human input, current MSLA printers support only single colors or materials.
