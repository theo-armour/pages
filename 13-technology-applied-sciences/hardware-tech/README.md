## Phones

>> Can I eliminate the landline and use only a mobile line?
Yes!
It's always good to have  - in case of emergency - two ways to communicate. Mobile device is one, hardwired Internet connection at home is second. No need for more.
>> Spectrum Mobile
I had never hear of them until now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Spectrum
Since Spectrum is your ISP and uses Verizon network, the deal looks good.
>> is 1GB adequate?
Start with 1GB then upgrade as needed
>> Consumer Cellular
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Cellular

Which do you prefer: the elephant or the mouse? Good reasons can be found for both. In case of emergency, elephant may be preferable 
>> Any other mobile service providers you recommend?
I use Google Fi and share the plan with my three daughters. Rons on top of T-Mobile. No extra charge  for data  when you are overseas is the plus for my daughters who travel a lot.
>> Are android or I-phones preferable?
I am Android. I buy a new high-end device - Samsung or Google Phones - every year and give previous year's device to a daughter. https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#explore phones for $50.
People do love Apple.  Pricier than Android. Once you get your data into the Apple walled garden, it is very difficult to get your data out. You become a "lifer"

I rarely talk on my phone, but it is always with me. I use it for calender, email, voice dictation, encyclopedia, weather oracle, map, book reader, music lyrics, telescope, microscope, plant identifier and more. 

I see my mobile device, it uses and usage an essential element of aging successfully
