In 1922 the society accepted the donation from Mrs Kate F Austin of the parcel of land surrounded by Francisco, Bay, Laguna and Octavia. Rather than constructing a new orphanage they decided to rededicate the Society to “the care of elderly women and convalescent women and children.” By February of 1923, the Society had viewed sketches prepared by Julia Morgan, the architect of thr Hearst Castle and well-known for earthquake resistent structures.

On March 3, 1925 the Society held its first meeting in the front parlor of the new Tudor style structure at 3400 Laguna Street.
