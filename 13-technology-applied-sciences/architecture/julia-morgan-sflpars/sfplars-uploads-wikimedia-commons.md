OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR
September 26, 2013
San Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief Society

It is an honor to greet everyone who has come together for your 160th anniversary celebration.

I applaud the San Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief Society and its long years of service to the people of San Francisco. Founded in 1853 to care for women and children abandoned during the Gold Rush, you have continued to evolve to serve the changing needs of the city.

Today, operating as The Heritage, you are providing independent living, assisted living and health care services for a rapidly expanding number of seniors. You do so with the same traditions of excellence, graciousness and generosity that has been a characteristic of your organization for the past 160 years.

Thank you for your dedication and best wishes for a memorable event and every future success.

Sincerely,
Jenny Brown
EDMUND G. BROWN JR.
GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN JR. SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 95814 (916) 445-2841
