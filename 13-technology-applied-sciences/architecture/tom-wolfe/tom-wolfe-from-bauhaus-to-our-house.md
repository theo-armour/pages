# Tom Wolfe ~ From Bauhaus to Our House

## 2023-02-26

A time-line of mid-century-modern architecture from its sources in the Vienna Secession to its "topping out" in the AT&T building - with sardonic comments throughout.

Reading it for the first time at my age. it comes as a joy and delight. It explains many aspects of my formation that I was quite clueless about.

There are no explanations about how or why the events turned out the way they did,

There is a teleological aspect - "it's inevitable" - about modern architecture that I had never considered

The collaboration, consensus, "code" and more were things I knew and even felt yet none of these aspects ever appeared in my workaday world. Lattimore, Solon, YRM etc: it was mostly always just a job.

There were inner dreams that occurred in my world that are derivative

* I bought what Tom Wolfe talks about: completely
* A dream was to be the equivalent of a medical general practitioner - quietly fixing up the ills of a neighborhood and adding new healthy things.
* A dream was that well-designed spaces could foster sociability

My first year design professor ?? at Syracise was the emdiment of the "code" and the persona - like ropius perhaps more than Corbu. I still resonate with many of those thoughts.
