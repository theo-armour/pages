# Optical Devices Read Me


## Phone Link

* Want huge 100x zoom
* Thus need a stable tripod mount
* Use a laptop to view the camera
* Use a FeiyuTech gimbal app to control the camera

Phone as webcam works but cannot control camera

## Dream Device

* Will a 20x optical zoom camera with a USB 3.0 satisfy me?
* Will Yashica binoculars with a camera satisfy me?

## USB power

* No DC in!
* USB 3.0?
* Type C
* Power can from a power bank, hub or computer
* Like USB display connect

At least:

* Pan Tilt Zoom
* 20X optical zoom
* 1080p or more
* USB 3.0?
* Table top only, not wall or ceiling mount
* But will the quality ever satisfy me?
