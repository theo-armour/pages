## Electrical Principles

## Units and terms: current, voltage, and resistance; alternating and direct current; conductors and insulators

* Voltage is a force measured in volts
* Current is the flow of electricity measured in amperes
* Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electricity measured in ohms
  * DC, AC & RF
* Alternating current (AC) is the flow of electricity that changes direction periodically
* Frequency is the number of times a wave repeats in a second measured in hertz
* Conductors are materials that allow the flow of electricity
* Metals are good conductors because they have free electrons
* Insulators are materials that do not allow the flow of electricity
* Glass, rubber, and plastic are good insulators

## Ohm’s Law: formulas and usage

* Ohm's Law states that the current in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance
* Ohm’s Law is E = I × R
* Resistance is R = E ÷ I
* Current is I = E ÷ R


## Series and parallel circuits

* Series Circuits: DC current the same through all components
* Parallel Circuits: DC voltage the same across all components


## DC power

* Power is the rate at which electrical energy is generated or used.
* Power is measured in watts.
* n P = E × I.

* mega- M 1,000,000 106
* kilo- k 1,000 103
* ---- ---- 1 100
* milli- m 0.001 10-3

* nano- n 0.000000001 10-9
* pico- p 0.000000000001 10-1


## Decibels

* Decibel scale is a logarithmic scale
* When the value is positive, it means that there is a power increase.
* When the value is negative, it means that there is a power decrease.
* know the ratios represented by the values 3 dB, 6 dB, and 10 dB
* 3 dB corresponds to a ratio of 2 to 1
* 6 dB corresponds to a ratio of 4 to 1
* 10 dB corresponds to a ratio of 10 to 1
