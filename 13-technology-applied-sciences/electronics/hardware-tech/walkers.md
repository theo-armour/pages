OasisSpace Pneumatic Armrest Walker, All Terrain Tall Walker with Seat,Tall Rolling Mobility Walking Aid with 12‚Äù Pneumatic Wheels, Seat and Armrest for Seniors and Adults
Return eligible through Aug 19, 2021

It is with heavy heart that I request a return authorization for thre OasisSpace All Terrain Upright Walker for the following reasons

Handles actual arm height only went up to 43 inches
Walker tends to pull to the left - even with tires fully pumped up
Steering is stiff; requires too much continuous upper body strength
Even with handles at rear, knees bump into the seat
Tire inflation nozzle hits against wheel bracket

The product concept is wonderful. The quality of the manufacturing, attention to detail, ease of assembly are all great. It was almost a dream come true. ;-()
