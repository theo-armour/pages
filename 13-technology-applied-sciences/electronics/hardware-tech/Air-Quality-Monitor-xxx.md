## PM10 : Particulate Matter 10

PM10 : Particulate Matter 10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers or less. Due to the larger size, the particles are inhalable but penetrate no further than bronchi as the larger particles can be filtered out by the cilia and mucus of nose and throat. PM10 particles are normally considered as less harmful to health than PM2.5.

## PM2.5 : Particulate Matter 2.5

PM2.5 : Particulate Matter 2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers or less. Due to their tiny size, PM2.5 may be absorbed into the bloodstream and the lungs. Long term exposure to high concentration of PM2.5 may cause eye and nose irritation, coughing, asthma, emphysema, lung disease, heart attacks, cancer etc.

## TVOC : Total Volatile Organic Compounds

TVOC : Total Volatile Organic Compounds : Various common VOCs include benzene, toluene, styrene, formaldehyde. Due to their volatility as well as toxicity, irritability and carcinogenicity, long term exposures to TVOC's may cause damage to the skin, liver, kidneys, central nervous system etc

## HVHO : Formaldehyde

HVHO : Formaldehyde (HCHO or CH2O) : Colorless and strong smelling gas with formula CH2O, which has been classified by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen. Long term exposure to just low doses could cause chronic respiratory disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colon cancer, brain tumors, nuclear gene mutation etc

## CO2 : Carbon Dioxide

CO2 : Carbon dioxide : a colorless and odorless gas that is usually derived from the breath of humans and animals. High CO2 concentration means that fresh air or ventilation is required, otherwise it may cause problems such as drowsiness, dizziness, loss of attention and cognitive impairment.
