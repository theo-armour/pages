### The right to clean air

Clean air is a human right.

The UN estimates that between 6 and 7 million people die prematurely each year as a result of pollution, and that around 90 per cent of the world’s population breathe polluted air.

An independent UN expert said that the failure of governments across the world to ensure clear air, constitutes a “violation of the rights to life, health and well-being, as well as the right to live in a healthy environment.”

Climate change mitigation consists of actions to limit global warming and its related effects. This involves reductions in human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as well as activities that reduce their concentration in the atmosphere.

In the US

The Clean Air Act is a United States federal law which limits national air pollution. Initially enacted in 1963 and amended in 1965, 1967, 1970, 1977, and 1990, it is one of the United States' first and most influential modern environmental laws, and one of the most comprehensive air quality laws in the world. As with many other major U.S. federal environmental statutes, it is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in coordination with state, local, and tribal governments.

> it is insufficient to treat clean air as a policy objective. It must be regarded as a fundamental human right, related to the rights of life, health, and a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.

In California

The California Air Resources Board (CARB ) is charged with protecting the public from the harmful effects of air pollution and developing programs and actions to fight climate change. From requirements for clean cars and fuels to adopting innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, California has pioneered a range of effective approaches that have set the standard for effective air and climate programs for the nation, and the world.

In San Francisco

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District aims to create a healthy breathing environment for every Bay Area resident while protecting and improving public health, air quality, and the global climate.

We maintain the right of Bay Area residents to breathe clean air.

### Know your air

You already know a lot of science:

* Temperature, humidity, air pressure, speed, direction, weather



### Knowing if your air clean

How do you know if the air you are breathing is clean? It's complicated. There are many factors.

Sources include: cooking, tobacco, pollen, animal fur, forest fires, viruses.

This paper is concerned with identifying spikes in pollution and suggesting remedies for two types: wildfire smoke and viruses as aerosols.

The degree of pollution caused by smoke and viruses is measured by looking at particulate matter.

Studies have found that tobacco smoke particle size ranges from 0.01 to 1.0 microns, with median diameters being in the 0.3 micron range (examples shown in Table I).

COVID19 has a diameter of approximately 60–140 nm or 0.06 to 1.4 microns.


### What are good indicators for smoke and virus aerosols?

* Smoke: AQI is a good indicator
	* PM2.5 (μg/m3) ~ number of items of particle matter less than 2.5 microns ( 0.0025 millimeter) in diameter per cubic meter
	* PM10 (μg/m3) ~ number of items of particle matter less than 10 microns ( 0.01 millimeter) in diameter per cubic meter
* Virus: CO2 is a good indicator

>Using CO2 to measure air circulation
>So how do you know if the room you’re in has enough air exchange? It’s actually a pretty hard number to calculate. But there’s an easy-to-measure proxy that can help. Every time you exhale, you release CO2 into the air. Since the coronavirus is most often spread by breathing, coughing or talking, you can use CO2 levels to see if the room is filling up with potentially infectious exhalations. The CO2 level lets you estimate if enough fresh outside air is getting in.

## Reference



CO2 : Carbon dioxide : a colorless and odorless gas that is usually derived from the breath of humans and animals. High CO2 concentration means that fresh air or ventilation is required, otherwise it may cause problems such as drowsiness, dizziness, loss of attention and cognitive impairment.


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_law

> Air quality laws govern the emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere. A specialized subset of air quality laws regulate the quality of air inside buildings. Air quality laws are often designed specifically to protect human health by limiting or eliminating airborne pollutant concentrations. Other initiatives are designed to address broader ecological problems, such as limitations on chemicals that affect the ozone layer, and emissions trading programs to address acid rain or climate change. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing air pollutants, setting limits on acceptable emissions levels, and dictating necessary or appropriate mitigation technologies.

>PM10 : Particulate Matter 10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers or less. Due to the larger size, the particles are inhalable but penetrate no further than bronchi as the larger particles can be filtered out by the cilia and mucus of nose and throat. PM10 particles are normally considered as less harmful to health than PM2.5.

> PM2.5 : Particulate Matter 2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers or less. Due to their tiny size, PM2.5 may be absorbed into the bloodstream and the lungs. Long term exposure to high concentration of PM2.5 may cause eye and nose irritation, coughing, asthma, emphysema, lung disease, heart attacks, cancer etc.

How small is 2.5 micrometers? Think about a single hair from your head. The average human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter – making it 30 times larger than the largest fine particle.

TVOC : Total Volatile Organic Compounds : Various common VOCs include benzene, toluene, styrene, formaldehyde. Due to their volatility as well as toxicity, irritability and carcinogenicity, long term exposures to TVOC's may cause damage to the skin, liver, kidneys, central nervous system etc

HVHO : Formaldehyde (HCHO or CH2O) : Colorless and strong smelling gas with formula CH2O, which has been classified by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen. Long term exposure to just low doses could cause chronic respiratory disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colon cancer, brain tumors, nuclear gene mutation etc

organic air pollutant containing one atom of carbon, one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. It has the chemical formula HCHO or CH2O.
