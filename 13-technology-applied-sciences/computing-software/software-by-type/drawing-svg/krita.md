# krita

* Gets very complicated.
* Bitmap interface overwhelms vector interface.

## Tips
* Clear = del key
* Show canvas only = tab key
* Erase = e = lower button
* command palette  = upper button

## zoom

* + will zoom in with discrete steps.
* - will zoom out with discrete steps.
* 1 will set the zoom to 100%.
* 2 will set the zoom so that the document fits fully into the canvas area.
* 3 will set the zoom so that the document width fits fully into the canvas area.

## Paint

* Extensive set of brushes
* Nice right click menu

## Vector

* Must create vector layer
* Vector line, fill and color in Tool Options docker
* No pretty VECTOR brushes
* Full add, edit and delete vertices
* Cannot join lines
