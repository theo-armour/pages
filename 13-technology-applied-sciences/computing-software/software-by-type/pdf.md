Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some of the best PDF editors in 2023:

1. **Adobe Acrobat Pro DC**: This full-service PDF-editing application offers a complete set of PDF-editing tools, and it even lets you edit scanned documents. Acrobat Pro DC's OCR engine can convert scanned documents to text, which you can then search through and change. It's priced at **$240/year** ¹.

2. **PDF Candy**: Our pick for the best free PDF editor is PDF Candy, because it offers something many free options do not — the ability to edit text in a PDF without leaving a watermark. It also allows you to convert PDFs to other formats, including Word and JPG ¹.

3. **PDFescape**: This web-based PDF editor is free and easy to use. It lets you edit text, images, and links in a PDF, as well as add new pages and forms ¹.

4. **Foxit PDF Editor**: This software is great for editing text, images, and links in a PDF. It also has a feature that allows you to create forms and fill them out electronically ³.

5. **Nitro Pro**: This software is great for editing text, images, and links in a PDF. It also has a feature that allows you to create forms and fill them out electronically. Nitro Pro is priced at **$159/year** ³.

I hope this helps!
