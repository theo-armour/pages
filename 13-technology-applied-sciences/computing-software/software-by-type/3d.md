## NerfStudio API

* https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/index.html
>Nerfstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and visualizing NeRFs. The library supports an interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component. With modular NeRF components, we hope to create a user-friendly experience in exploring the technology. Nerfstudio is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can easily build upon each other’s contributions.

### Thoughts on Universal Scene Description (USD)

USD is a scene description format for interchange between 3D tools. It was developed by Pixar and used in their own software in production. It is open source and has been adopted by other software vendors.

It's both an API and file format for storing and interchanging 3D data. It's a way to describe 3D scenes in a way that's independent of the software used to create them.

In some ways it's similar to glTF, but it's more general purpose and more complex. It's not a format that's suitable for use in a web browser. It's more suitable for use in a 3D modeling tool or game engine.

It reminds me of a markup language that combines HTML, JavaScript and CSS in one file.

It's too complicated for somebody like me to use, but it's a good thing to know about. It's more suitable for the devops and full stack developers.

It's easier to let Rhino or Blender or Maya or whatever do the conversion to USD for you. Interestingly, Revit does not support exporting to USD format (yet).

There are so many different formats for 3D data, and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. It's difficult to know which one will be winners. Only develop for a particular format or API is somebody is willing to pay you to do it.
