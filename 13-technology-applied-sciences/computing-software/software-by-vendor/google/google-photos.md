## Creating a shared album

There are several way to create a shared album in Google Photos. Here are two ways to do it.

I believe that album sharing must be started when the album is created. I don't think you can share an album after it has been created.



### On a Computer

Create a shared album by

* Go to the Sharing tab in the left menu
* Tap "Create shared album" on the upper right.
* Add Title
* Select photos, select each photo you want to include,
* Tap "Done"
* Tap "Share" om upper right.
* Invite people via a link or through a messaging app.

### On a Mobile Device
