First real day playing with Obsidian. It certainly has a lot of cool tricks. And it's easy to learn. Very few surprises. 

The problem is that I will still have to use VS Code in order to push my files to GitHub. 

Also, accessing files from Android could be difficult. 


### Obsidian MD for VSCode

Besides Wikilinks and backlinks, I wonder what I will get that will be useful to me that I cannot get in VS Code. 


## Foam

This extension looks like it does a lot of what Obsidian does, and it's inside of VS Code and is being updated and has 200K users, so probably is a good way of getting Obsidian features and still be in VS Code.
