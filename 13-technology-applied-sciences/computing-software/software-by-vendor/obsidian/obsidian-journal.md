Both Foam and Obsidian have so many issues with VS Code.

Film requires much customization of folders or preparation or something, I'm not sure what. Perhaps it's just non-standard Markdown.

Obsidian, and VS Code are just different apps.It would mean using both.

Maybe one day VS Code will have Wikilinks, backlinks and tags built in.

But for now, regular markdown links will have to do.  And given that we're talking about getting things running on GitHub Pages, then having full links that work either from Pages or from locally or in the browser, they all need to be fixed links.

First real day playing with Obsidian. It certainly has a lot of cool tricks. And it's easy to learn. Very few surprises.

The problem is that I will still have to use VS Code in order to push my files to GitHub.

Also, accessing files from Android could be difficult.

Besides Wikilinks and backlinks, I wonder what I will get that will be useful to me that I cannot get in VS Code.


## Foam

This extension looks like it does a lot of what Obsidian does, and it's inside of VS Code and is being updated and has 200K users, so probably is a good way of getting Obsidian features and still be in VS Code.
