Favorites.vscode

The more I look at it, the more useful it looks like it can be.

Unfortunately, the instructions are incomplete.

At the same time, I'm finding many new tricks in VS Code. It is part of one of my long-standing mental models. Follow what the programmers do. Programmers invented email, programmers invented all sorts of things that become common use after a number of years after programmers developed them.

* Word processing came after code editors.
* Email came from network messaging.
* Spreadsheets came out of CSV files.
