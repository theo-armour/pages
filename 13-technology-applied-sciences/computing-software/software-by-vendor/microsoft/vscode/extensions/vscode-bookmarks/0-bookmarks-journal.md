# Bookmarks journal

## 2025-09-09

I keep thinking that I had an old Bookmarks Manager that had features that I liked, but I can't find it. But that's probably my imagination. I'm probably still using the one I always liked, But forgetting how I modified it.

So, After playing all morning, it turns out Favorites.VSCode is probably still the best for me.

Nonetheless, I still don't understand all the settings and I seem to have put a bug into it.
