# Scrapbook

## 2025-09-24

Hi @adzierzanowski

vscode-scraps is a great extension. Thank you for creating it!

I have a few suggestions for new features that would make it even better:
1. **Tagging and Categorization**: Allow users to tag or categorize their scraps for easier organization and retrieval.
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar to quickly find specific scraps based on
3. **Sorting Options**: Provide options to sort scraps by date created, date modified, or alphabetically.
4. **Color Coding Group Icons**: Allow users to assign colors to individual group icons for visual differentiation.
5. **Drag and Drop Reordering**: Enable drag-and-drop functionality to reorder scraps within a group or move them between groups.

Items 3 and/or 5 would be especially useful for me **today**. Tell me where to send a donation of $50 if you implement any of these features.

Cheers,

Theo
