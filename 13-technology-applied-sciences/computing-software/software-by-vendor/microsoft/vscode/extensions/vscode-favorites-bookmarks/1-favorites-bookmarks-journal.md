I had another look around. It's best to search on favorites rather than bookmarks.

Unlike Shilo, KDC at allows me to see all the folders. I still have to open them up upon first opening VS-code.

KDC allows you to assign colors to folders.

I keep thinking that I had an old Bookmarks Manager that had features that I liked, but I can't find it. But that's probably my imagination. I'm probably still using the one I always liked, But forgetting how I modified it.

So, After playing all morning, it turns out Favorites.VSCode is probably still the best for me.

Nonetheless, I still don't understand all the settings and I seem to have put a bug into it.
