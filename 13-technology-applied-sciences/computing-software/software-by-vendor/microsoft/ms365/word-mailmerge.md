To insert a field code in Microsoft Word, you have several methods available:


### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

1. **Direct Insertion**:
   * Position the cursor where you want to insert the field.
   * Press `Ctrl + F9` to insert a pair of curly brackets `{}`.
   * Type the field code within the curly brackets (e.g., `DATE` or `PAGE`).
   * Press `F9` to update the field and display its result[1][2][4].


### Using the Ribbon Interface

1. **Insert Tab**:
   * Position the cursor where you want the field.
   * Go to the `Insert` tab.
   * Click on `Quick Parts` in the Text group.
   * Select `Field` from the dropdown menu.
   * In the Field dialog box, choose the desired field from the list and configure any necessary options.
   * Click `OK` to insert the field[2][4].

### Typing and Converting

1. **Manual Typing**:
   * Type the desired field code (e.g., `DATE`).
   * Select the text you just typed.
   * Press `Ctrl + F9` to convert the text into a field.
   * Press `F9` to update the field and display its result[2].

These methods allow you to efficiently insert and manage field codes in your Word documents, providing dynamic content that updates automatically based on the field's properties.
