Hello Microsoft 365 Support

I have a Microsoft 365 Family account that I would like to transfer from my Gmail account to my Outlook account.

I currently use t.armour@gmail.com to sign in to my Microsoft 365 Family account. I would like to change the sign-in to t-armour@outlook.com

Please help me learn how to do this.
