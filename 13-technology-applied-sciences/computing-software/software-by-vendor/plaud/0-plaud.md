Besides Plaud, I've played with three voice recorder devices. None satisfy.

### Always on recording

Takes too much time to review the recordings to locate the worthwhile bits

### Complexifications

Getting the text to where I want it takes too many device interactions and clicking.

Creating agents that might make that happen takes too much learning and setup time.

### Uses

I do use Plaud for recording meetings and lectures. I like that I can turn it on and leave it on the table, which means I'm still free to look at my phone without changing the position of the microphone.

### Push-to-talk

I still like the idea of having a small device that I can wear, that I can push to talk. Like a walkie-talkie. It's nice to be able to record the odd snippet of a thought from time to time.

Currently, I mostly do this by pulling out my phone, waiting for it to turn on, clicking an icon that brings up the notepad, and then using voice-to-text.

### Limitless

Looks like perfection!

My hesitation: Pricey subscription before I start. I've already paid for several subscriptions to some of the other stupid devices. Plus all the other possible complexifications that these devices seem to enjoy incorporating.

* I wish the phone app had a push-to-talk feature.
* Need a save to GitHub feature
