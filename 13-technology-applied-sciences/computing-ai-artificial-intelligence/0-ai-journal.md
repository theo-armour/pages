Help me collaboratively develop a well-structured and effective prompt through an interactive Q&A session. Start by asking me clear, specific questions about the purpose, audience, tone, desired output format, and ethical considerations of the prompt. For each question, offer a few options or suggestions to guide my responses while remaining adaptable to my unique requirements.

After each iteration, summarize the refined elements of the prompt so far, and identify areas that need further clarity or detail. Include strategies or examples where helpful, such as templates for specific domains (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, or customer support). Continue refining until we arrive at a clear, actionable, and contextually appropriate prompt that aligns with my goals.

Birthday cake with the text "Happy Birthday Tucker". A 3D render of  a typical Thomas Kinkade painting, characterized by its idyllic and romanticized depictions of landscapes and architecture, often imbued with a distinctive glow known as the "Kinkade Glow."  It is serene and picturesque scene depicted in a way that evokes a sense of nostalgia and tranquility.
The light is exaggerated to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. This includes highlights, halos, and a hyper-luminescent shine that gives the scenes an ethereal quality. The color palette in Kinkade's work is typically soft and pastel, contributing to the dreamlike quality of his paintings. These colors help to enhance the idyllic nature of his scenes.

I can enhance an existing image and keep it the same size:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1086529016183406643/1209741464829956157/theoarmour_mobility_manufacturing_crafting_healthy_moving_peopl_3be99166-da71-4af6-969f-89de5a1e5fbb.png?ex=65e80689&is=65d59189&hm=3363ddb468393744dd9140d593463fa02d3bb49b06fac99de0e6686ce8cdfbc1&

or I can make an existing image square :

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1086529016183406643/1209741450649272321/theoarmour_mobility_manufacturing_crafting_healthy_moving_peopl_497963f6-36b5-45e3-bf07-85f92b7993ac.png?ex=65e80685&is=65d59185&hm=d0ef8ae080b1ee3d6fab882dfba0b0c260a7c6aee54bfa4d38cb842180cd9e26&

But if I change the size, I get four new images:

Each image can be separated out and enhanced.

They are numbered 1 to 4 from top left going clockwise. image 3 is lower right.

So I will now use the same prompt I used before but change the size.

Pied Beauty
BY GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS
Glory be to God for dappled things –
For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;
For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;
Landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough;
And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.

All things counter, original, spare, strange;
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)
With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:
Praise him.

The Second Coming
By William Butler Yeats
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

Today I would describe my energy color as pastel pinks and purples, with shapes similar to soft clouds, floating, the speed of the energy is slow and the music that would resemble it is slow classical piano.

### Chirp Generated Text 2

[Verse]
Today, my energy's hues shine bright
Pastel pinks and purples, soft and light
Like drifting clouds, I gracefully soar
A gentle breeze, slow, forevermore

[Chorus]
In this world of calm, my spirit roams
Through melodies on keys, my energy flows
In shades of pinks and purples, I find peace
With slow-paced piano, all worries cease
Style of Music
classical piano

Drawing of an imaginary Heritage

I experiment with various applications of artificial intelligence (AI). I asked the "Midjourney" application to create a drawing with these instructions: "Old peoples home, 3D cutaway, red brick Tudor mansion, Style of Pieter Bruegel the Elder". I think she did a pretty good job. What do you think?

Husk & Stone was created in the context of a desire for renewal, diligence, growth, and positive impact after spending over 12 years building urban mobility startups in Europe and the US. By way of consulting – or preferred word collaborating – we see this as an excellent opportunity to help existing teams do a deep dive on a project, accelerate growth, and bring an external perspective or fresh energy. With an entrepreneurial spirit at the core, we look to work with dynamic teams working on impactful projects who want sustainable growth, from an ESG perspective but especially on an operational level.

***

The name Husk and stone is inspired by the beautiful contrast and natural value of corn or wheat husks and olive stones (or pits). These two materials together symbolize fragility as well as strength.

While a husk is protective, temporary, encompassing, light, soft, and delicate- a stone is robust, at the core, hard, and foundational.

Both have important values; energetic value as well as growth value. We chose these symbols for their contrast, how they relate to nature and the earth, as well as their value in renewable energy and circularity.

Grit

“Husks and stones are the grit used for creating energy, just as human grit is required for building a startup”

almond husk, walnut husk, hazelnut husk, olive pits, peach pits, avocado pits

## 2023-03-12 ~ Dall-E Prompts

What would you enter as a text prompt for DALL-E 2?
As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to enter text prompts for DALL-E 2 myself, as it is a separate machine learning model developed by OpenAI. However, if you're looking for a prompt to use with DALL-E 2, you could try something like:

"Create an image of a fantastical cityscape with towering skyscrapers made entirely out of plants and flowers."

or

"Generate a picture of a giant squid wearing a top hat and holding a cane, surrounded by a group of curious onlookers."

Remember that DALL-E 2 is designed to create images based on text descriptions, so the more detailed and specific your prompt is, the better chance you have of getting a satisfying result.

please create eight more prompts

Certainly! Here are eight more prompts you could use with DALL-E 2:

"Create an image of a mermaid riding a motorcycle along a beach at sunset."
"Generate a picture of a treehouse that looks like a giant mushroom, with a spiral staircase and a balcony overlooking a river."
"Create an image of a robot gardener tending to a garden of floating, glowing orbs."
"Generate a picture of a dragon playing a game of chess with a knight in a medieval castle."
"Create an image of a futuristic city with flying cars, holographic billboards, and giant neon-colored mushrooms growing out of the buildings."
"Generate a picture of a group of penguins wearing backpacks and climbing a snow-covered mountain."
"Create an image of a giant, three-headed dog guarding the entrance to an underground cave filled with treasure."
"Generate a picture of a giant snail wearing a crown and holding a scepter, with a group of tiny knights riding on its back."

Create an image of rolling hills on a dark and stormy night with a fantastical cityscape with towering skyscrapers made entirely out of plants and flowers.
