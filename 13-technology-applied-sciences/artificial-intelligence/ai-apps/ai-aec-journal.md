First post on AI in AEC

### Publishers

Most publication in AEC do *not* cover AI in AEC in any detail. We looked at over forty AEC publications and found that only a dozen or so had any articles on AI in AEC.

### Applications
The number of currently available AI applications in AEC appears to be small ~ perhaps a few dozen. Currently eleven are listed in "Design" and fifteen in "Workflow". The number will certainly grow as I further explore the topic, but don't expect the the number of existing plugins to double.

### Vendor Size
Most currents apps appear to be from new small startups. Most of them do not appear to be funded.

All the big CAD vendors already say they already have AI somewhere in their apps.

Examples:
* Autodesk ~  https://www.autodesk.com/products/forma/overview
* Bentley Systems ~ https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/case-studies/bentley-systems
* Nemetschek ~ https://blog.nemetschek.com/en/topics-and-insights/ai-building-lifecycle
* SketchUp ~ https://www.sketchup4architect.com/ai-plugins-for-sketchup.html


### Vendor Strategy

The big AEC CAD vendors vendors are throwing around the largest investments in AI. Much of that money will go to acquisitions.

### Conclusion

"AI in the AEC sector is certainly under development, but it's not yet ready for widespread implementation. Given the complexity of tasks in the AEC industry and the current state of AI technology, it may be several years before we see significant disruption in job roles. Whether AI will be a game changer in AEC or simply another tool in the toolbox is still unclear. This will likely depend on factors such as advancements in AI capabilities, industry acceptance, and the development of effective use cases that can demonstrate clear benefits over traditional methods.
