The Facilities Committee includes quiet and noise control as regular items in its agendas

The ambient noise levels at HotM at a variety if locations, dates and times are recorded and monitored

* Sounds emanating from fans and pumps will be particularly close monitored

Residents are are notified in advance of possible noise disturbances via their preferred method of communication

Any contractor bringing in equipment that creates noise shall be made aware of HotM quietness guidance

Upon first entry of vehicles or equipment to thr HotM campus, a member of the Facilities Committee shall be notified. The Committee member shall use a sound level meter to identify and record the maximum noise level produced.

If the noise level is found to be excessive and the situation is not an emergency, then any member of the HotM community may request that the activity be paused until such times [A Decider] has determined the best course of action.

Contractors are required to follow specified noise pollution guidelines

* Contractors will use white nose warning systems always

SEC. 2900.  DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   (a)   Building on decades of scientific research, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have determined that persistent exposure to elevated levels of community noise is responsible for public health problems including, but not limited to: compromised speech, persistent annoyance, sleep disturbance, physiological and psychological stress, heart disease, high blood pressure, colitis, ulcers, depression, and feelings of helplessness.
   (b)   The General Plan for San Francisco identifies noise as a serious environmental pollutant that must be managed and mitigated through the planning and development process. But given our dense urban environment. San Francisco has a significant challenge in protecting public health from the adverse effects of community noise arising from diverse sources such as transportation, construction, mechanical equipment, entertainment, and human and animal behavior.
   (c)   In order to protect public health, it is hereby declared to be the policy of San Francisco to prohibit unwanted, excessive, and avoidable noise. It shall be the policy of San Francisco to maintain noise levels in areas with existing healthful and acceptable levels of noise and to reduce noise levels, through all practicable means, in those areas of San Francisco where noise levels are above acceptable levels as defined by the World Health Organization's Guidelines on Community Noise.

The horn shall be maintained in an operative condition.

No employer shall permit earthmoving or compacting equipment which has an obstructed view to the rear to be used in reverse gear unless the equipment has in operation a reverse signal alarm distinguishable from the surrounding noise level or an employee signals that it is safe to do so.

The beep that’s driving me insane

In the Ear of the Beholder
Back-up alarms continue to evolve and improve.

Once considered optional equipment, back-up alarms have become a necessity on moving industrial equipment. You'll find them on emergency and maintenance vehicles, construction and earthmoving equipment, buses, trucks, forklifts and utility vehicles, to name a few.

Can we stop the loud-beep on backing up?
One of the scourges of urban areas is the requirement (I presume) that heavy equipment make a loud beeping noise when it’s backing up. It’s meant to warn anybody standing behind the vehicle, presumably because the driver doesn’t have the same field of vision to see you, and because people are more wary of standing in front of a moving vehicle than behind it.

* https://vertikal.net/en/news/story/6991/noisy-cherry-picker
>There is an increasing tendency for building work near offices, hotels or hospitals to require quieter equipment, at least for working during specific times, such as early morning, evenings and weekends.


## Organizations

People do try to do something about this, but not particularly effectively in the US. (European cities are far quieter.)

* https://nonoise.org/
>The Noise Pollution Clearinghouse is a national non-profit organization with extensive online noise related resources.
>NPC seeks to:
>* Raise awareness about noise pollution
>* Create, collect, and distribute information and resources regarding noise pollution
>* Strengthen laws and governmental efforts to control noise pollution
>* Establish networks among environmental, professional, medical, governmental, and activist groups working on noise pollution issues
>* Assist activists working against noise pollution

* https://chchearing.org/noise/
>The Center for Hearing and Communication is proud to offer the Noise Center as a public service for people seeking information about the dangers of noise exposure and the steps they can take to promote a safer and quieter world.
>
>Exposure to noise is the leading cause of hearing loss—not age. Repeat exposure to noise at a level of more than 85 decibels (dB) can result in permanent hearing problems. The good news: noise-induced hearing loss is preventable. The key is to minimize your exposure to noise and take appropriate action to protect your hearing when you’re in a noisy environment.

[NoiseOFF]( http://www.noiseoff.org/ )
>NoiseOFF is a free online resource for citizens, elected representatives, law enforcement professionals, educators, researchers, students and activists from the United States and abroad. The website comprises a working toolkit that people can use to reduce noise pollution in their lives and communities.

[Noise Free America]( https://noisefree.org/ )
>Noise Free America is a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting noise, especially from boom cars, car alarms, leaf blowers, barking dogs, and motorcycles. Our mission is to elevate the issue of noise pollution with federal, state, and local officials, as well as to educate the public about the dangers of noise pollution.
