# Notesy GGPF

## Concept

* Get and Put Markdown files to a private or public GitHub repo
* Display in HTML, supports details tag
* Edit in HTML
* Toggle display content as html, Markdown or HTML text
* Save as Markdown
* API and update via location.hash
* Autosave by time or on blur
* Check for change before exit
* Display Get and Put time and byte count
* Load test files
* My primary test bed for Markdown to HTML and back
* Footer dingbat to go to top of page

## Reminders

* Notesy expects the full URL
* Runs on its own and in an iframe
* Inits if it's on top; waits if it's in an iframe
* Its location.hash is all it needs
* Updates via href, hash and src

``` JavaScript
<div id="divMainContent">
    <iframe id=ifr src="github-get-put-file.html"></iframe>
</div>
```

## Change Log

I've run scripts like this one countless times without issue. I am an experienced developer working with the console window open. It is is used interchangeably on GitHub and locally using "--allow-file-access-from-files". 

Can you see any "Gotchas" or anything interesting to tweak in the code?
