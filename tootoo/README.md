* Interact with files with the fewest possible clicks. As easy as sending an email
* Accordion tree view menu of all the files in a repository.
* Browse the entire contents of files in a repository very quickly
* View contents of many file types including images, text, and HTML files.
* Open files in a new tab or window so they can be printed or shared.
* Hosted on GitHub Pages, so all benefits and safety of GitHub.
* Viewed using Pages, no server required.
* Code is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* No dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries.
* No need to install anything.
* Works on all modern browsers.
* Runs locally on your computer.

## Change Log

### 2025-05-31

* Clean-up & refactor
* 2023-10-14 ~ Cursor keys to load next file in menu

#### prompt

Suggest further improvements, retaining the notion that the project is intended to be as simple as possible, and given that the project operates in a known and well-maintained environment, it requires only the minimum of error checking, if any

#### Prompt

On the tree view menu, add the capability to open and view the next or previous file in the menu using the cursor keys.

#### prompt

currently there is a toggle to open or close all the details tags in the tree view. 

Improve this by adding a right-click menu to toggle between opening and closing all the sub-folders of the currently selected details tag in the tree view.

worked!

#### prompt: 

Add a function that scales the text size larger and smaller of of all the item in the menu and body, including the tree view, using two buttons, one to increase the text size and one to decrease it.

Worked!

### 2025-05-29

* 2025-05-25 ~ sort folders with files staring with dates with newest at top

Prompt, this worked!

on a hash change make sure its associated "file-container" menu item for that item is visible by setting all its parent details to open. Do this in the simplest way possible, by using the "open" attribute of the details tag.
