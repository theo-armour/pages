# [Paris]( index.html )

## History

Who called it [_Lutetia_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutetia )? The Romans did.

## Your AirBnB

What is the [entry code]( https://www.parislogue.com/travel-tips/30-paris-tips-6/ ) for the door?

How many seconds until the light in the hall turns off and you are in the dark?

Who gets to go in the tiny elevator with the suitcases and who has to walk up the stairs?

Where are the garbage bins and what rubbish do you put where on what day?

Where is your closest supermarket for toilet paper and stuff?

The frozen food from [Picard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard_Surgel%C3%A9s) is not bad at all.

## Communicating

Bring a GSM phone with you and purchase a pre-paid phone chip with cheap data plan almost anywhere

## Dates to remember

June 21. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte_de_la_Musique


## Transport

Learn to Velib. Your credit card has no chip? Not to worry: http://en.velib.paris.fr/

Stoplights are not where they are meant to be, so you don’t know where to stop, do you?

A vehicle to the right of your automobile has unmitigated and total right of way (_priorité à droite_)

Know where your taxi stand (_tête de station_) is located.

What is the number for Taxi Bleu? Have a look at http://www.taxis-bleus.com/


## Things to see and do

There are not that [many circuses]( https://en.parisinfo.com/what-to-do-in-paris/info/guides/going-to-the-circus-in-paris "The capital has several big tops and other venues where you can discover circus arts with the family" )in Paris, but many more than most cities.

There is one of the ~[163 museums in Paris]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_Paris) close by to almost anywhere.

Boats are for exploring sewers, the Seine and canals.

The [Catacombs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris ) are truly scary.

Where did Ravel compose “Bolero”: http://www.maurice-ravel.net/belved.htm

Go see Jean Tinguely’s “Cyclops”. http://www.lecyclop.com/en/index.html

## Sunday

Everything closes on Sunday. Except in the 4th arrondissement, where everything closes on Saturday and opens on Sunday.

On Sunday, somewhere in your arrondissement, there is a pharmacy and a boulanger that opens at least briefly.

Sunday is for parks, the Champs Elysées [beware the pickpocket] and visiting people.


## Geography

You are never more than 500 meters from the green cross that indicates ‘pharmacy’. Whatever you need, the pharmacy can supply this afternoon.

Your arrondissement is divided into _quartiers_. Learn their four names. Wonder if you are living in the French Quarter.

There are twenty _arrondissements_ in Paris. Learn that the _arrondissements_ are laid out as a clockwise spiral starting from, doh, the Louvre.

Every arrondissement has a swimming pool and a town hall where fun stuff happens.

The closer you are to the 1st arrondissement, the thinner and better-dressed the people are. The further away you go, the easier it is to find parking spaces.


## Socializing

When you kiss, the head moves to the left on the first kiss. Always.

The only people you don’t shake hands with are the people you kiss on both cheeks.

Shake hands with everybody, all the time. Especially in your café.

You have to spend a bit of time and effort learning which café is your café, but once you learn which one it is, you will go there twice a day.

Walking. It’s about the walking.

After five days of walking by a café where everybody is looking at you, you start to dress better.


## Eating

Eat in restaurants where the dish of the day is written on a blackboard. Alice Waters learned this trick in Paris.

Order the dish that’s on the blackboard – especially if you have never had it before.

There are three restaurants that are too small to be in any guidebook within walking distance of where you live that prepare simply awesome food. Find them.

Restaurants that serve good food are not hidden behind curtains or walls. You can look inside and see the clientèle.

If the clientèle of a restaurant is attractive to you then you will like the food served there.

As long as they don’t have to cross a street, after several visits with the parents, quite young children may be given the responsibility to fetch the bread from the boulanger in the morning.

Somebody has to get the _baguette_, ficelle, _pain au chocolat_, _croissant_ every morning.

Children will learn not to put their fingers on the glass of the display cases at the patissier.

Your children understand how to handle eating at a restaurant. Don’t they?

## Shopping

When you enter the shop you say “Bonjour, Madame.” When you leave the shop, you say “Merci, Madame.”

Even if the person behind the counter is, like, fifteen you still say “Bonjour, Madame.”

On market days, you buy your food at the market.

You buy a hard, a medium and a soft cheese.

You know that there is a proper way to cut each type of cheese. Slicing the cheese incorrectly is vulgar.

Today you buy the food you will eat today. Except for Saturday when you may also buy food for Sunday.

You have a market bag, don’t you?

## Whatever

The French use the least amount of soap per capita in Europe [citation needed]. Maybe because a bar of _savon de Marseille_ truly lasts just about forever.

By law, the pharmacist must be able to tell you if the mushroom you have is edible.
