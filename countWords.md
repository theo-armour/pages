Built in 1932, the Doelger Building merges Art Deco and Streamline Moderne styles in its stepped tower entrance, glass block windows, and speedline canopy. It was headquarters for Henry Doelger Builder Inc., a firm that transformed the Sunset District from windswept sand dunes to a neighborhood of mass-constructed houses for the working and middle classes. Henry Doelger, once dubbed "The Poor Man's Frank Lloyd Wright," was a master builder, entrepreneur, and prominent community figure. His residential tracts are affectionately called Doelgerville and Doelger City.
