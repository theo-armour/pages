# Self-Tagging ~ Marching Cubes

* Carefully curated empty space may become useful.
* Empty spaces mau be comprised of subspaces tht follow certain patterns of certan truthinesses
* These patterns may follow certain rules that have statistical significance
* Once a pattern id identified, it may be used to predict future patterns
* it may be used to enable a store of meta knowledge that further informs the data at hand without adding extra fields of increasing the length of the data
* Alternatively, it may be used to enable more effective processing of the data by allowing the data to be processed in a statistically more efficient manner

Example

* We know this type of numeric data almost always has 20 zeroes at the beginning
* We can use these 20 spaces to store alphanumeric data
* If data item arrives with the some first 20 spaces filled with numbers, we know to skip adding our alphanumeric data
