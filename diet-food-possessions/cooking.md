>Described as a biopolymer, our bamboo fibre is comprised of about half bamboo fiber, a highly renewable material, and half non-toxic food-grade A5 melamine binder, which helps to extend the life of the products (a sustainable practice!). Our bamboo is FSC-certified meaning it is responsibly-sourced and managed. It is collected as sawdust waste from chopstick factories. Our material is stable, unchanging and poses absolutely no health risk with daily use and is suitable for hot and cold foods and liquids. There is no need for an external varnish, and the product maintains its appearance over time as it is the same material inside and out. Our products feature a premium matte finish. There is no varnish, coating nor paint on the surface of our products, so theyâ€™ll never fade, peel or leach harmful chemicals. All BIOBU products undergo regular and rigorous testing.
