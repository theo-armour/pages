* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Morgan

> Julia Morgan (January 20, 1872 – February 2, 1957) was an American architect and engineer. She designed more than 700 buildings in California during a long and prolific career. She is best known for her work on Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California.
>
>Morgan was the first woman to be admitted to the architecture program at l'École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the first woman architect licensed in California. She designed many edifices for institutions serving women and girls, including a number of YWCAs and buildings for Mills College.
>
> In many of her structures, Morgan pioneered the aesthetic use of reinforced concrete, a material that proved to have superior seismic performance in the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes. She embraced the Arts and Crafts Movement and used various producers of California pottery to adorn her buildings. She sought to reconcile classical and Craftsman, scholarship and innovation, formalism and whimsy.
>
> Julia Morgan was the first woman to receive American Institute of Architects’ highest award, the AIA Gold Medal, posthumously in 2014.

Look like a fairly good bibliography. Nice short summary of her life that is more complete than Wikipedia.

Julia Morgan was a notoriously private person who shunned publicity. Little is known about her childhood or personal life. But no matter—she left behind a most lasting impressions on California’s landscape and a hard-to-miss hole in the architecture field’s glass ceiling .

Morgan holds the record for total completed structures designed by a single American architect—she designed more than 700 buildings (most of them houses), so many that even just her Bay Area contributions exceeds the capacity of any one map or index.

### The Heritage, San Francisco ~ https://homepages.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/jmheritage/jmheritage.html

> The Ladies Protection and Relief Society (founded in 1853) commissioned this retirement home for elderly women

> The structure is made of reinforced concrete (a building material Morgan often used) and faced with brick. Terra cotta trim decorates the building, although it is not multi-colored. (Many of Morgan's works use colorful mat-glazed terra cotta. See, for example, the Oakland YWCA.) Morgan used a variety of historic styles, here a vaguely English style. The facade is symmetrical with decorative chimney caps and down spouts at regular intervals. The central bay has a larger dormer at the top with a decorative front-facing gable with five windows and a finial at the summit. The second register of the central bay features a three-sided overhanging porch.

>Through fire and shock, the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed more than 80 percent of the city’s buildings. The grand Fairmont Hotel, only days from opening, was gutted by flames, leaving only a shell.
>
>The hotel’s owners, determined to rebuild, turned to a young architect, Julia Morgan. Only three years earlier she had built a bell tower on the campus of Mills College, and it had withstood the earthquake unscathed —  proof that Morgan was as experienced in reinforced concrete as she was in European design.
>
>But word that a woman had been hired to renovate the luxurious hotel was met with astonishment. Was the building really in the charge of a woman? Jane Armstrong, a reporter for The San Francisco Call, asked the project’s foreman in 1907 on a visit to the hotel’s ballroom after Morgan had restored it to its original splendor.
>
>Yes, the foreman answered, it was in the charge of “a real architect, and her name happens to be Julia Morgan, but it might as well be John Morgan.’ ”

>Miss Morgan graduated with a degree in civil engineering from University of California at Berkeley. During her time at Berkeley, Morgan developed a keen interest in architecture, which is thought to have been fostered by her mother’s cousin, Pierre Le Brun, who designed the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower in New York City. At Berkeley one of her instructors, Bernard Maybeck, encouraged her to pursue her architectural studies in Paris at Ecole des Beaux-

>This year’s winner, Julia Morgan, is another posthumous honoree: She was born in San Francisco in 1872 and died there in 1957. Aside from a childhood year in New York and an important six-year stint in Paris, during which she became the first female student to earn a degree from the architecture division of the École des Beaux-Arts, she spent her entire life in Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. Though she designed a YWCA in Honolulu in 1920 and sent sketches by mail for a house to be built in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1928, nearly all of her commissions were in her home state.
>
>And a staggering number of commissions there were: Morgan, the first female architect to be licensed by the state of California, oversaw more than 700 built projects during her career, or an average of 15 per year between the time she founded her San Francisco office in 1904 and her decision to close it in 1951, when she was 79. (By contrast, Maybeck, her friend and mentor, completed an average of roughly two buildings per year.) Geographically, the California projects ranged from the Herald Examiner Building in downtown Los Angeles, a combination of Moorish and Mission Revival styles, all the way north to Wyntoon, the estate near Mount Shasta and the Oregon border where she designed several buildings between 1924 and 1943 for the newspaper’s owner, William Randolph Hearst. Along with his mother, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, he was Morgan’s most consistent and supportive client, commissioning her to design the extravagant group of buildings in San Simeon, Calif., known collectively as Hearst Castle.
>
>Morgan’s specialties included private houses as well as YWCAs and other women’s clubs in several California cities. (A loose group of well-connected women around the state gave her support and work throughout her career.) The biggest collection of her work at one site is the Asilomar Conference Grounds, on the Monterey Peninsula, where she designed a total of 16 buildings for the YWCA between 1913 and 1929.
>
>That prolific output is one reason it has taken so long for Morgan’s work to win the sort of national notice symbolized by the AIA Gold Medal, which has never before gone to a woman. There was something supremely methodical, even metronomic, about her practice. (“She ran as efficient an office as I’ve ever been in,” one of her employees said.) Typically we consider that sort of steadiness as being at odds with singular genius, which the clichés have led us to believe comes in bursts of unpredictable inspiration.
>
>Morgan was hardly the kind of architect to madly sketch plans that had suddenly come to her on the back of a napkin. (I’m not sure any architect is, really, but she never came close to filling that stereotype.) Her muse was the grindstone. During her most prolific years, her office juggled two or three dozen projects at the same time. She often worked 18-hour days. She never married.
>
>Morgan produced no manifestos, and she shunned the press. As Sara Holmes Boutelle, Morgan’s biographer, put it, “She steadfastly refused to enter competitions, write articles, submit photographs to architectural magazines, or serve on committees, dismissing such activities as fit only for ‘talking architects.’ ” Morgan had a similarly dim view of prepping her archive for posterity. When she retired, she had all her blueprints and other materials destroyed. She figured the only people who might have any use for them were her clients. And they had their own copies.

## Books

>The book is unrivaled in taking us behind the scenes, at make-believe San Simeon, still a Hollywood playground in that period, and beyond the myths surrounding the estate. Wyntoon, another of Hearst's fabled retreats in California, is covered as well. The Loorz Papers also delve into Hearst and Morgan's further pursuits, such as their Grand Canyon project in Arizona.
>
>From bank failures and presidential races to Hearst's royal entertaining and the opening of the Big Sur highway, the subjects here are part of an ever-changing pageant. Insightful and poignant, humorous and candid, Building for Hearst and Morgan-offers unique perspectives on a vivid era whose like we'll never see again.

Julia Morgan, America’s first truly independent female architect, left a legacy of more than 700 buildings, many of which are now designated landmarks, in cities throughout California, as well as in Hawaii, Utah, and Illinois. Her work spanned five decades, and the total of her commissions was greater than any other major American architect, including Frank Lloyd Wright. This book tells the remarkable story of this architectural pioneer, and features text, drawings, and photographs of the many buildings that still exist.
