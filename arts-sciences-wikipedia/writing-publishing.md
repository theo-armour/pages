## Publishing

* https://scroll.com/
Scroll distributes your membership to sites you read based on their share of your engagement. Those sites make more money than they would from showing you ads and deliver you a faster, better experience. Every month, we’ll tell you where your membership went and which sites you supported.

The Washington Post has built a multi-publisher, shared-subscription system in its tech labs — one of three components of its digital advertising suite of tools called Zeus — and is considering deploying a “Zeus Pass” to allow users to sign in once and get access to multiple publications in the Zeus network, the paper’s chief technologist says.


## Web publishing personal

* Too important to leave to someone else
  * Unless you want a "ghostwriter"
* Too sacred to have to pay money for
  * How you mush is your love, epiphany, enlightenment?
  * Free is good
* Best to learn to do it yourself
