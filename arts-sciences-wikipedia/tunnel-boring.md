## Ideas

* Tunnels under every interstate
* Tunnels become the best way to automate the long distance movement of goods
* Don't think of just one tunnel borer digging a mile a month; think of a hundred diggers working in parallel
* Mining operations: start with a big bore than have multiple small bores branching off the big bore
* Use tunnels to store water in high places or compressed air or hydrogen to generate electricity
* Can little tunnels be refitted into bigger tunnels?
* Tunnels as a way of moving water with less loss, wastage and energy.
