# Sense of Smell

_Text in gray is text from the source article_

## Preface

In June I put together this write up about Frauke Galia for the [_Heritage Happenings_]( https://heritage-happenings.github.io/ )

>Aromatherapy with Frauke Gallia
Monday July 18 at 3:00 in Friendship Hall
_Hi! I'm Frauke and I want to teach you how to harness your sense of smell to be well. I’m a Certified Level II Aromatherapist, smell coach, and teacher who’s spent her career in Perfumery, and I want to help you feel more vitality, joy and calm. I want to teach you how to use (or regain) your sense of smell, with support of essential oils and nature, to improve and maintain your smell health. I'm often referred to as “the smell lady” because of my deep passion for connecting people with their sense of smell. I believe that smelling is a privilege and that society undervalues this beautiful and critical sense. My philosophy encourages a mindful connection with smelling for both health and well-being._

The event was well attended and we participants were very pleased with what we had learned, experienced and smelled.

Until this event I had not given much thought about the sense of smell. But being inspired by Frauke's seminar, I have spent an engaging few hours rummaging around the Internet seeing what I could smell.

The text and links below highlight pages I have looked at. It is typical of the general overview I tend to put together when approaching an unfamiliar topic. I generally start by ["standing on the shoulders of giants"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants ) - using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress.

I like the idea of adding a story to https://www.scenttattoo.com/ - and will do so before too long, fingers crossed. I also expect that there might be some overlap with my evereverland project and heavenly smells

## Wikipedia: Articles

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_smell

>The sense of smell, or olfaction, is the special sense through which smells (or odors) are perceived.[1] The sense of smell has many functions, including detecting desirable foods, hazards, and pheromones, and plays a role in taste.
>
>In humans, it occurs when an odor binds to a receptor within the nasal cavity, transmitting a signal through the olfactory system. Glomeruli aggregate signals from these receptors and transmit them to the olfactory bulb, where the sensory input will start to interact with parts of the brain responsible for smell identification, memory, and emotion.
>
>There are many different causes for alteration, lack, or disturbance to a normal sense of smell, and can include damage to the nose or smell receptors, or central problems affecting the brain. Some causes include upper respiratory infections, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disease.


### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_art

> Olfactory art is an art form that uses scents as a medium. Olfactory art includes perfume as well as other applications of scent.
>
>The art form has been a recognized genre since at least 1980. Marcel Duchamp was one of the first artists who pioneered with using scents in art.


### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatherapy

>Aromatherapy is based on the usage of aromatic materials, including essential oils, and other aroma compounds, with claims for improving psychological or physical well-being. It is offered as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative medicine, the first meaning alongside standard treatments, the second instead of conventional, evidence-based treatments.
>
>Aromatherapists, people who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of supposedly therapeutic essential oils that can be used as topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion. There is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can either prevent, treat, or cure any disease. Placebo-controlled trials are difficult to design, as the point of aromatherapy is the smell of the products. There is disputed evidence that it may be effective in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting.


### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromachology

>Aromachology is the study of the influence of odors on human behavior and to examine the relationship between feelings and emotions. Those who practice aromachology are aromachologists. Aromachologists analyze emotions such as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and well-being brought about by odors stimulating the olfactory pathways in the brain and, in particular, the limbic system. Different wearers are thought to have unique physiological and psychological responses to scents, especially those not manufactured synthetically but based on real scents.


### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scentography

> Scentography is the technique of creating and storing odor by artificially recreating a smell using chemical and electronic means.

### Aromatherapy With Essential Oils

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65874/

This summary contains the following key information:

>* Aromatherapy is the therapeutic use of essential oils (also known as volatile oils) from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) for the improvement of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.
>* Aromatherapy is used by patients with cancer primarily as supportive care for general well-being.
>* Aromatherapy is commonly used with other complementary treatments (e.g., massage and acupuncture) as well as with standard treatments for symptom management.
>* Essential oils are volatile liquid substances extracted from aromatic plant material by steam distillation or mechanical expression; oils produced with the aid of chemical solvents are not considered true essential oils.
>* As essential oils age, the chemical composition changes. Many essential oils do not have an expiration date.
>* Essential oils are available in the United States for inhalation and topical treatment. Topical treatments are generally used in diluted forms.
>* Aromatherapy is not widely administered via ingestion.
>* The effects of aromatherapy are theorized to result from the binding of chemical components in the essential oil to receptors in the olfactory bulb, impacting the brain’s emotional center, the limbic system. Topical application of aromatic oils may exert antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.
>* Studies in animals show sedative and stimulant effects of specific essential oils as well as positive effects on behavior and the immune system. Functional imaging studies in humans support the influence of odors on the limbic system and its emotional pathways.
>* Human clinical trials have investigated aromatherapy primarily in the treatment of stress and anxiety in patients with critical illnesses or in other hospitalized patients. Several clinical trials involving patients with cancer have been published.
>* Aromatherapy has a relatively low toxicity profile when administered by inhalation or diluted topical application.
>* Aromatherapy products are not subject to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unless there is a claim for treatment of specific diseases.

### The Centuries-Long Quest For The Scent Of God

* https://www.noemamag.com/the-centuries-long-quest-for-the-scent-of-god/

>The precise odor of the divine has eluded humans for millennia, but that hasn’t stopped us from seeking it in the oddest places.
>***
>Indeed, some scholars believe that the English language suffered from the “cultural repression and denigration of smell” during the Enlightenment, as improvements in hygiene and objections to “superstition” transformed the lived environment into one less sensorially confrontational. Though the theory is controversial, Asifa Majid, an Oxford cognitive scientist, found that today, the English language is relatively weak when it comes to words for smells. “There are few terms for odors, odor talk is infrequent, and naming odors is difficult,” she wrote. Smells have never been so ineffable.
>
>But for Cockayne, it’s not all bad. There is an opportunity today to rethink and broaden our experience of the smell of God, he said. “Could the smell of freshly brewed coffee count as a religious experience?” he wondered. “If we are happy to think that experiencing a beautiful sunset or a piece of sacred music can be an experience of the divine, then there is no reason to exclude olfactory experiences from having such significance too.”
>
>A waft of rich coffee. A whiff of incense. A sweet stench from a saintly corpse. The search for the odor of sanctity, the smell of God, goes ever on.

Collection of ten nicely smelly articles

> Our sense of smell has a reputation for being underdeveloped — but this is ill-founded. The events of the past two years, in which millions of people lost their sense of smell to COVID-19, have put the spotlight on research emerging from the world of olfaction.


### Arch Daily > Sensory Maps: What the Sense of Smell Can Reveal about Urban Environments
https://www.archdaily.com/985983/sensory-maps-what-the-sense-of-smell-can-reveal-about-urban-environments

> Every city is a complex environment, bringing together people, cultures, architecture, commerce, and even nature. While experiencing a city, a lot of attention is given to its appearance, but appearance is not everything. The theory of sensory design aims to go beyond vision and explore the richness of the built environment through textures, smells, and sounds. For city officials and planners, a lot of attention generally goes towards how a city looks and sounds, but in terms of smell, the focus is mainly on managing waste or cleaning unsanitary areas. Yet the sense of smell, so often overlooked, is strongly linked to the creation of emotional memories. It contributes to our understanding of the world; it reveals otherwise hidden cultural practices, and it rounds up the experience of an environment.
