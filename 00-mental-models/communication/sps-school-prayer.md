# Saint Paulâ€™s School ~ The School Prayer

I recited the following prayer frequently during mu six years at Saint Paul's School. Many years later I was reminded of it. Atheist as I am, I still find its petition and reminders resonates well with my mission in life.

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."
