Any writing regarding open source software implies 'Standing on the shoulders of giants'.

Would it be a nice thing if the following condition was in the CONTRIBUTING document?

* Each guide includes a short bibliography or reading list of links at the end of each guide.

The purpose is either to help the reader identify the sources of inspiration for the current guide or to present links for further reading on the topic.

Suitable links - along with a short description - submitted via GitHub Issues might be a fun way of involving the user community. Suggested links might need to have a certain number of thumbs-up votes in the issue in order to be included.

Here are a few sample suggestions:

### 'Starting an Open Source Project'

* [Free and open-source software]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) ~ Free open source software as described in the elephant in the room

### 'How to Contribute to Open Source'

* [Readme Driven Development]( http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html ) ~ 'There must be some middle ground between reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.'

### 'Getting Paid for Open Source Work'

* [How I Stumbled Upon The Internet’s Biggest Blind Spot]( https://medium.com/@nayafia/how-i-stumbled-upon-the-internet-s-biggest-blind-spot-b9aa23618c58 ) ~  insightful investigation on the status of funding for open source projects
