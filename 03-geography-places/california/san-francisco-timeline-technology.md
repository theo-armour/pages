1800s, San Francisco's port helped make it a hub of the early telegraph and radio industries.

1865 ~ transcontinental railroad was completed in Promontory, Utah. This made it easier to get to California, and San Francisco became a major hub for the railroad industry.

1870s, the city became a major hub for the silver and gold mining industries. This made it a major banking center.

1887 and 1895,[5] Charles Fey of San Francisco, California devised a much simpler automatic mechanism[6] with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell;

1909, San José became home to one of the US's first radio stations.

1926 ~ Philo T Farnsworth invented the television in San Francisco.

1933, the Navy purchased Moffett Field to dock and maintain the USS Macon. This made Moffett Field a major hub for the early days of the aerospace industry. Many scientists and researchers all found work in the area.

1939, the Ames Research Center was founded in the area, and it became home to the world's largest wind tunnel in 1949.

1939, William Hewlett and Dave Packard founded Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, which originally made oscilloscopes. Then, during World War II, HP made radar and artillery technology. At this point, computers were about the size of a room.

1940s, William Shockley coinvented the transistor while at Bell Labs. The transistor is now known as the computer processor. In 1956, Shockley left Bell and founded his own company — Shockley Semiconductor Labs. It was the first company to make transistors out of silicon and not germanium. The company was founded in Mountain View, California — so Shockley could be closer to his sick mother. Shockley's company employed many recent grads of Stanford.

1957, eight Shockley employees grew tired of his demeanor and left the company. Shockley called the group the "Traitorous Eight." They partnered with Sherman Fairchild to create Fairchild Semiconductor. In the early

1960s, Fairchild helped make computer components for the Apollo program. Later in the decade, many of the "Traitorous Eight" left Fairchild and founded their own companies. Including Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who in 1968 founded their own company in Santa Clara called Intel. Soon after, other ex-Fairchild employees and "Traitorous Eight" members helped found AMD, Nvidia, and venture fund Kleiner Perkins.

1969, the Stanford Research Institute became one of the four nodes of ARPANET. A government research project that would go on to become the internet.

1970, Xerox opened its PARC lab in Palo Alto. PARC invented early computing tech, including ethernet computing and the graphical user interface.

In 1971, journalist Don Hoefler titled a 3-part report on the semiconductor industry "SILICON VALLEY USA." The name stuck.

1970s, companies like Atari, Apple, and Oracle were all founded in the area

1980s, Silicon Valley became the widely accepted center of the computer industry. eBay, Yahoo, PayPal, and Google are just some of the companies founded in the area

1990s With Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and Tesla joining them the following decade. The growth of the tech industry in the area continues to this day.
