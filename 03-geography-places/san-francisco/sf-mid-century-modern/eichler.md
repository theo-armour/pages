## Key Characteristics of Eichler Homes:

* https://share.google/aimode/aqWZRNUMUt7FZUpNy
* Eichler homes are known for "bringing the outside in" through a "California Modern" aesthetic.
* Architectural Style: California Modern, inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.
* Construction: Post-and-beam framing allowing open spaces and varied rooflines (often low-pitched or A-framed).
* Post-and-Beam framework eliminates the need for load-bearing interior walls, allowing for wide, open floor plans and expansive glass.
* Flat or Low-Pitched Roofs: These contribute to the homes' sleek, horizontal profiles.
* Exterior: Clean geometric lines, few street-facing windows, and a focus on blending with nature.
* Atriums: Many models feature an open-air, enclosed entrance foyer or central courtyard that integrates nature into the home’s core.
* Floor-to-Ceiling Glass: Massive windows and sliding glass doors blur the boundary between indoor living spaces and backyards or patios.
* Indoor-Outdoor Living: Floor-to-ceiling glass walls, atriums, courtyards, and private patios.
* Interior Design: Open floor plans, integrated furniture, radiant floor heating, and natural materials like wood paneling.
* Radiant Heating: Most were built with hydronic radiant heating systems—hot-water pipes embedded directly into the concrete slab floors.
* Social Impact: Affordable housing for diverse communities, a rarity for the era.
