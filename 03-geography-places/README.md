## Worldview

A worldview or world-view is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual's or society's knowledge and point of view. A worldview can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "ground" in Gestalt psychology and media analysis.

According to Apostel, a worldview is an ontology, or a descriptive model of the world. It should comprise these six elements:

* An explanation of the world
* A futurology, answering the question "Where are we heading?"
* Values, answers to ethical questions: "What should we do?"
* A praxeology, or methodology, or theory of action: "How should we attain our goals?"
* An epistemology, or theory of knowledge: "What is true and false?"
* An etiology. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.
