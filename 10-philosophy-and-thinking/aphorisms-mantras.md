## Preface

See post in EEL > Journal > Slogans that Sizzle

I like aphorisms. Aphorisms are pithy observation that contains a general truth, such as, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". An aphorisms is a short and simple way of expressing or referring to something longer or more complex.

Aphorisms are useful in naming or representing mental models. They are like verbal icons - aural instead of visual

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model

>A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about their own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.

Aphorisms may also become slogans - offering information to consumers in an appealing and creative ways.

### pot shots

* [https://www.ashleighbrilliant.com/WhatIsaPotShot.html](https://www.ashleighbrilliant.com/WhatIsaPotShot.html)

From __Give yourself the unfair advantage__ p240

Though it may not be readily apparent, there is a structure - some rules - underlying the Pot-Shots. First is brevity: no longer than 17 word because at the time he began formulating rules, he had already formulated many potshots and the longest was 17 words. Also, Japanese haiku poetry uses exactly 17 syllables not words. so 17 it is.

Second principle is universality: ever the intuitive global thinker, from the start he decided to avoid puns, rhymes, word-play for reference is unique to one language or culture, and to use only simple, common, easily translated words. This put a premium on "irony, ambiguity, subtlety, audacity, paradox and crazy logic.”

Third is originality: though they must sound like everyday speech, they must not be something said before. As Shakespeare might have said(but didn't), "the Words the thing". The illustration is incidental (though often adds greatly to the impact, given the old rule about how many words a [well chosen] picture is worth).

Ashleigh's delightful illustrations are worth their weight in - words.
