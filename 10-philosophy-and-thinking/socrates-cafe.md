## Café philosophique

* https://www.cafesphilo.org/

> The subjects discussed at the cafés had a range that varied from the Santa Claus myth to truth to beauty to sex to death. They posed such questions as What is a fact? and Is hope a violent thing? Sautet made the discussions seem fun and exciting. The concept was to bring people together in a public friendly forum where they could discuss ideas.
>
> Philosopher Thomas Morris has praised the Socrates Cafe concept of good discussion about important topics by common people
>
> Phillips has inspired individuals to create in their own communities voluntary groups who convene to discuss philosophical questions they themselves have chosen."
>Blacker considers the Socrates cafe endeavor to be a critical effort for evolving a democracy, the essential function and mission of which to him is for its citizens "to think for themselves about the lives they want to lead"


## Socratic method

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method

> The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions.

> The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs. The basic form is a series of questions formulated as tests of logic and fact intended to help a person or group discover their beliefs about some topic; exploring definitions, and seeking to characterize general characteristics shared by various particular instances.

### Socratic Circles

> A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”

## Mission

What do we at Democracy Cafe do really well, and that sets us apart?

We inquire Into questions as timeless as they are timely and pertinent to one and all. It’s why pro-democracy luminaries like Lawrence Lessig and Cornel West of Harvard have readily agreed to be on our board, so enthusiastically do they share our since of mission.

We have a genuine, time-tested method of inquiry that facilitates the discovery of new portals of knowledge, new ways of doing, being, saying, making. Others claim to feature  methods of discourse, when in fact what they have is restrictive protocol, formats and rules of engagement that might make sure those involved are ‘civil’ to one another, but do not afford authentic opportunities for testing, scrutiny, evolution of thought and deed.

We promote and model ‘thinking in colors’ — from the questions we frame and subsequently explore, to the way we go about answering them.

We don’t argue, we don’t debate, we don’t seek to persuade others. Instead, we explore, interrogate, investigate — and seek to persuade ourselves (that’s right, we focus on supporting our views via ‘self-persuasion,’ rather than patronizing proselytizing and sermonizing). In doing so, we become more connected to others — including if not especially those who look at the world quite differently than we do — more bonded to ourselves, to our universe.

We tap into, early and often, our childlike questioning nature, so we can maintain our capacity to be a ‘child at heart’ — open and curious and empathic — at every age and stage of life.

Everyone, from the youngest to the oldest, takes part as equals. Everyone. That’s what true ‘democratizing’ is all about. So, whether you are 5 or 95, whether you have multiple PhDs or have never set foot in the hallowed halls, each of you has a wealth of experiences and beautiful stores of wisdom to share from which the rest of us can benefit and become potentially transformed

We listen to one another with all our being, with all our heart and mind. Because what the world needs now is a world of heartfelt, empathetic listeners.

And in doing so, we can transform our inner and outer worlds, which are interlaced.

And we are inspired to act in the world with a greater sense of autonomy and keener social conscience (the two are not at opposite ends of the continuum, but are entwined).

We are genuinely inclusive. We don’t just tolerate but embrace the equal consideration of a plurality of perspectives. And we have no political agenda except to create more open societies in which we all give equal consideration and scrutiny to a bracing variety of points of view — with the aim of evolving who we are and who we can be, on individual, local, national and global scales.

We don’t force artificial consensus, we don’t force thoughtfulness or reasonableness or civility down people’s throats — rather, these often are both an outcome of the kinds of inquiries we promote, and of the ethos that is entwined with them, and such qualities are embedded within the explorations themselves.
