The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are
* Consequentialism, which judges actions based on their consequences.[130] One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce.
* Deontology, which judges actions based on whether they are in accordance with one's moral duty.[130] In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences.[130]
* Virtue ethics, which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do.[130]

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:[2]

* Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined;
* Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
* Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.[2]
