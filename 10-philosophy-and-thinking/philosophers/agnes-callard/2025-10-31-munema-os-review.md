## II Major concepts

### Untimely questions

“An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time—namely, after it has been answered. Untimely questions are remarkable not only because they are hard to answer, but, first and foremost, because they are hard to ask; and they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to pose them to others, but, first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself…The reason why you can’t ask yourself untimely questions is that you think you already have the answer to them, and the reason you think you have the answer is that you are using the answer. Such questions don’t show up to you as questions; by the time you get them in view, you find that they have hardened into the shape of answers.”

### Load-bearing answers

The answers to untimely questions, held over a long period of time, and causing intense emotions like anger, grief, and fear if disrupted.

### Savage commands

“When you need answers to a question before you know how to ask it, that is when you become susceptible to a form of speech that can only be described as a command…We are the sorts of beings who need answers before developing the ability to ask questions, and who therefore rely on answers to unasked questions.” The reason it is called a command is because it is not an answer to a question, but a command that one must follow without much thought. In contrast, “the Socratic method is an alternative to savage commands. It takes the form of a proposal: either you are going to be convinced by me, to go along with what I think, or you are going to convince me to go along with what you think.”

### Bodily commands

The body answering untimely questions by telling you to pursue pleasure. For example: care about your personal interests.

### Kinship commands

Communal (family, friends, societies) answers to untimely questions, i.e. societal dictates on how to live, what to care about, etc. For example: care about courage, fairness, etc.

### Wavering

“Refusing to say the same things about the same subjects” i.e. “disagreeing with oneself,” which is “a sign that one has cut off an investigation before it came to a close, or that one never even opened it.” Because we don’t genuinely inquire into questions and instead follow commands, we “consign ourselves to a lifetime of wavering.”

### Socratic ethics

An intellectualist ethics that posits that if one knows, then one acts correctly. So if one does not know, the only thing to do is to ask questions and inquire into these things. “So long as you don’t know, holds Socrates, the proper ethical attitude is an inquisitive one.” “The hard work of struggling to be a good, virtuous, ethical person—Socrates understands that work as, first and foremost, intellectual work. These three features of Socratism “that we don’t now know, that if we knew we would act on our knowledge, and that intellectual conversations are the road to becoming a good person” add up to an intellectualism.”

### Thinking

“using the Socratic method to inquire into untimely questions,” where the method is “a social quest for better answers to the sorts of questions that show up for us already answered. It is a quest because it has a built-in endpoint: knowledge. It is social because it operates by resolving disagreements between people. Thinking begins when Socrates, or someone like him, recognizes that his account of justice, or piety, or love is not as good as it could be, which is to say, that it does not qualify as knowledge. This realization prompts him to ask another person for help inquiring into questions…the two parties come to agree. This does not mean that the quest is completed: both parties can go on to subject what they have agreed on to further tests of the same kind in future disagreements with others… It is completed when one arrives at an answer that is perfectly stable. The arguments with which it has been definitively “tied down” can then be conveyed to others, and this is why, if one has knowledge, one can teach it to others. Thinking is the road from ignorance about the most important things to knowledge about them.” Of note, thinking has to subject to standards of thoughtfulness (i.e. daydreaming is not thinking), and thinking is a process that can be applied to any topic (unlike e.g. addition).

### FONA (fear of never arriving):

“a fear of being deprived of both present and future goods: if I will never arrive at the goal of the activity I am currently engaged in, then I might as well not have done any of it.” This is the primary fear of a philosopher, i.e. that her inquiries will never be answered. The response to this, so that one does not give into despair, is some mixture of hope and faith in a general philosophical community. In contrast to Socratic hope, Tolstoy is engulfed by FONA and despairs of his life ever being enough to answer existential questions; thus, he never begins to inquire.

## III The paradoxes

The heart of the book is the claim that this sort of social/dialogical thinking can answer three important paradoxes. Here, I will sketch the paradoxes and the answers to them, as well as my criticisms of the answers.

### The Gadfly-Midwife Paradox
The paradox: You can be truth-seeking in two ways: by avoiding false beliefs and/or by believing true things. The issue is that these result in different doxastic attitudes or “rules” about what you should believe. If you value avoiding false beliefs, then you should not believe anything at all. If you value believing true things, then you should believe anything whatsoever. The question is: how can someone both pursue truth and avoid falsity?

Resolution: The two rules don’t conflict if they are given to two different people i.e. in dialogue. One person takes on the role of the gadfly, questioning everything to avoid falsity, whereas the other takes on the role of the productive midwife, i.e. asserting her beliefs. Since thinking is paradigmatically social, real thinking only happens in dialogue with others.

### Moore’s Paradox
The paradox: It is impossible to sincerely assert, “I believe X but X is not true.” e.g. “I believe it is raining but it is not raining.”

Resolution:

It is not only possible to sincerely assert a Moorean sentence, but it is necessary to our intellectual endeavours because the process of trying to refute someone is just trying to get them to sincerely assert a Moorean sentence. We assert Moorean sentences at the precise moment of being refuted because being refuted requires recognising that one is being refuted. This is a sort of jerk to the mind: oh my God, I believe something that is false! But this requires another person.

An analogy: you can’t really break promises to yourself—it’s hard to know whether you broke the promise or just let yourself out of the promise. But you can break promises to others—they can help you assess whether you broke a promise or not. This suggests that certain normative assessments are modified when other people are involved. Being refuted is like that: it involves thinking about one’s own thoughts, and it requires a second person to help you see whether you’ve been refuted or not: “I cannot distinguish between ‘something I believe’ and ‘a truth about the world’ introspectively, because I cannot assess my own beliefs for truth while continuing to believe them; but of course my beliefs are accessible for truth, and the practice of assessing them is one I can participate in with the help of another.”

Moore’s paradox is a type of self-blindness (you can’t believe X but also see that X is false). It is analogous to being unable to see one’s own pupil. In order to see the pupil of one’s eye, one has to have a mirror, i.e. an external object which reflects back to you. Similarly, in order to address self-blindness of a Moorean strain, one needs an interlocutor.

Typically, one might try to address this blind spot by suspending judgment, i.e. “I typically believe X but in order to assess X, I will suspend judgment on it for now.” But untimely questions are precisely those which, definitionally, one cannot suspend judgment on (since they are being actively used all the time). Instead, you would waver on the answer: “I typically believe X but maybe it’s really Y that’s true, oh but according to this other guy it’s Z.” So instead, you need an interlocutor who will basically disagree with you till the end—the gadfly to your midwifery.

### Meno’s Paradox
The paradox: In order to search for X, you have to already know what X is. For instance, if I am searching for my keys, I have to know what my keys look like and what keys are. So when it comes to searching for an answer X to a question, then I should already know what the answer X looks like. But if I already know what X looks like, then I already know the answer. So my search is pointless. Conversely, my search is impossible, i.e. even if I got the answer to the question, I could never recognise it as such.

Resolution: Progress to answering a question is only possible alongside someone else who has a different answer to the question. Answering a question is a type of hunting. People can pick up different scents in the realm of ideas—think different ideas are true—and then compare them to one another in a process of inquiry. This type of hunting cannot be done alone because when we do it alone, our answer is either satisfying (so we stop asking) or we “lose hold of the question.” But if we have different answers to the same question, “we can test our answers against one another” and thus make progress.

Of note, the point is that you somehow are able to recognise that one answer is better than another, a recognitional capacity which Socrates famously chalks up to recollection from a past life—a sort of “aha!” or eureka moment. Callard does not exactly spell out how this is possible, but just that it is possible because it happens when we learn geometry and suddenly recognise that Pythagoras’ theorem is correct (aha!):

Socrates’ point is: Whatever it is that you think is necessary to assume in order to be able to believe in the possibility of searching for the answers to questions, which is to say real questions, by contrast with those that are really problems in question clothing, assume that.

### Criticisms

Let us grant that one asserts a Moorean sentence when refuted and that we “catch the scent” of ideas when we explore them. Neither one of these shows the stronger claim that thinking is inherently dialogical/social. In order to show this stronger claim, it is crucial to Callard’s point that one cannot suspend judgment of untimely questions; one can only waver about them. (For instance, see the resolution to Meno’s Paradox or Moore’s Paradox.) But this just does not seem to be true—at least, not for the spaces of time that is required to inquire into something. For instance, if I read a Platonic dialogue (many of which can be read in one sitting), I have suspended judgment on that issue for the space of time I am reading the dialogue.

What seems more pertinent to untimely questions is that you cannot suspend judgment forever since you actually need the answers. This investment in the answers to untimely questions probably affects one’s motivation to examine or re-assess them, along with the evidentiary standard for giving credence to a claim, but this is precisely where conversation seems to come into play.

The relevance of the dialogical/conversational form seems to be:

Just by virtue of how dialoguing works, it creates a temporal space where one can withdraw from the answers to the questions in order to suspend judgment on them. Nobody is Socratizing with their bestie while actively mothering, for instance. You’re probably doing it after the kids are asleep, or when they’re in school, and so on. These are the times when you can disengage from the answers. Certainly, some questions are very hard to disengage from—”what is the meaning of my life” still plagues you while you’re dialoguing—but the participant seems to be giving you a sort of hope or even permission that you can suspend the answer for a while in order to inquire into it. Notice that all of the Socratic dialogues take place with them standing or sitting around, i.e. not doing anything else. Conversation allows for you to be doing something while not doing other stuff. It’s a type of overt, external activity that can stop you from living your regular life (for example, prosecuting your father for murder).

As Callard rightly points out in Part III, dialoguing motivates by making hopefulness more possible and overcoming FONA (fear of never arriving at an answer). In general, conversations motivate you to keep examining your load-bearing answers, whether through inciting hope, creating interesting alternatives, or just plain ol’ fashioned peer pressure (witness how Socrates uses sophists’ own vanity against them to force them into conversing with him, even when they would much rather have skedaddled).

These reasons show why autodidactism is so difficult, but neither of these reasons suggest that dialogue is necessary to thinking as a concept per se, except in some psychological way.

Another reason to think suspension of judgment is possible is because that is clearly what is happening when one internalises the dialogical process. Callard asserts that though thinking is paradigmatically social, one can imagine pretend interlocutors and think internally alongside these interlocutors. This is supposed to be a rather cheapened version of real thinking, but thinking nevertheless, so this version should also be able to answer the paradoxes.

But consider an analogy: playing chess against yourself. I have done this many times, and the only thing I know for sure is that whatever I am doing when I do it, I am not playing chess, but some sort of exercise in absurdity. This is because I know both sides in advance. Playing chess is more than just the “form” of playing chess. There is something that another person can bring—uncertainty, novelty, freshness—that I can’t bring to myself.

Similarly, if all dialoguing was were a testing of answers against one another, it would be relatively simple to do it by myself. Socrates could just say, “Crito, what’s your answer to X?” and then spend his time imagining his own internal dialogue with Crito. But what dialoguing really brings is something only someone else can bring: socio-psychological factors like motivation, hope, shame, etc., and the ever-important dose of originality.

Additionally, dialoguing by oneself seems to require that you are able to suspend judgment—you are playing the part of not only Socrates and his interlocutor, but of the audience as well. And the audience is the one who has suspended judgment (or at least, they aren’t sure what to think). If thinking-as-dialogue is possible internally, it is only possible insofar as suspension of judgment is possible. But if this is the case, then all of the resolutions to the paradoxes, insofar as they deny the possibility of suspension of judgment, suffer a blow. The claim has to become much weaker: “dialogue can serve as a place where paradoxes can be resolved, but so can other types of non-dialogical thinking.” And that’s still interesting, but certainly less so.

I should say something here about non-dialogical thinking. What could it be? While acknowledging the importance of dialectic to thinking, here’s one idea: non-dialogical thinking involves vividly imagining oneself in a whole different headspace, a whole different worldview. This happens when we take on characters (such as a gadfly or a midwife), but also when we decide to intensely study the thought of another thinker. It does involve being someone else, but not necessarily conversation. Instead, it’s like putting on a costume for the sake of understanding all the implications of a worldview.

This costume-view is even harder to do for untimely questions, and I think people who do this have a much harder time bringing philosophy into their “real life” for this reason. It has to be demarcated from the decisions they are making until or unless the play runs its course. Then you can decide whether the costume stays or it goes—and perhaps that process involves conversation, although it may just be a matter of seeing what “fits” better, what seems more elegant, or what makes most sense. In any case, it’s a different type of vision of thinking than the one Callard is proposing.
