Interesting article. Thank you!

In the meat world, it is difficult to meet people who share a similar world view.

Online, it is easier. You are not alone.

Following Camus and evolutionary anthropology and "why beauty?", for a while I have taken positive psychology as the bridge:

Martin Seligman /https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology

More recently, I have been exploring a "psychologically rich" lofe via:

Shigehiro-Oishi / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigehiro_Oishi

and occasionally throwing in a bit of:

Agnes Callard / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Callard

But I think the real trick in all of this is just simply growing old well.

At 78, I've never been happier!
