## How to say 'I'm sorry' -- and mean it
* <http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sc-apologizing-effectively-family-1006-20151001-story.html>
1. An "I'm sorry" statement.
2. Expression of regret for your mistake.
3. An acknowledgment that social norms or relationship expectations were violated.
4. A statement of empathy in which you acknowledge that you understand how your actions my have hurt the other person.
5. A request for forgiveness.


Making an apology last

Make it heartfelt. If you don't mean every word of your apology, don't expect the person you've wronged to buy it. Did you learn something about yourself in the process? Explain that, Alpert said.

No excuses. "Don't try to explain away why you said or did something wrong," Alpert said. Instead, be direct and tell the truth about what happened.

Put yourself in the shoes of the person you hurt. Consider how the person you hurt was affected by your behavior, Alpert said. Did it cause sadness, anxiety, fear? Show empathy and, during the apology, say you understand why he or she may have felt those emotions.

If you vow to change, then … change. "Words without action are empty and meaningless and often just reinforce the belief ... that you aren't sorry at all," Coleman said.


## The Right Way to Say ‘I’m Sorry’

* When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology, it’s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message
* The best apologies are short and don’t include explanations that can undo them
* Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology
* The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person’s reaction to it.
	* Saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns “I’m sorry” into “I’m not really sorry at all,”

	* This is the classic “I’m sorry you’re upset” apology, which has to rank up there with one of the more enraging things one person can say to another. It accepts no responsibility for harming the other person and only commiserates with their distress, like “Wow, I’m so sorry you’re sad about your cat’s death,” not “I’m sorry I killed your cat.” It very subtly implies that there’s something wrong with your emotional makeup that you’re so upset about something that is, evidently, not even worth apologizing for.
	* A good apology is simple: I did it, I was wrong, it’s my fault,

	1. You actually have to use the words I’m sorry.
	2. Acknowledge that you messed up. (As in, “I take full responsibility for my words.”)
	3. Tell the person how you’ll fix the situation.
	4. Describe what happened, but without foisting the blame off on someone else.
	5. Promise to behave better next time.
	6. Make sure the person knows you know exactly how you hurt or inconvenienced them.
	7. Much like the first rule, it’s important to use some version of the phrase “I was wrong.”
	8. Ask for forgiveness.

	* Bad apologies, on the other hand, tend to suffer from these four shortcomings:

	1. Justifying your words or behavior.
	2. Blaming the victim.
	3. Making excuses.
	4. Minimizing the consequences. (“It was just a joke!”)
