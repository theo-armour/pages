"Time Defeated by Love, Beauty and Hope"

***

Having a place for things is important to me

As an architect: dining rooms need kitchens, bedrooms need bath rooms
As a computer dude, there has to be a folder and file system
As a parent there have to be rules and guidelines

Over the decades I have spent much time on

Carnagie, Covey, GTD and such. All good

But they are about looking at behaviors, managing the flow of things, gauging success and failure

Recently, I have been researching my own ideas for "knowing being doing" that I have been calling "perceive act judge" (slightly different order).

All of these systems are good, fun and useful. They tell you the who, when, where and and even some of the why of doing things.

But they are kind of skimpy on the **what**

In fact they are so skimpy of the what that I never really knew that I needed a whot thing. It was an unknown unknown to me.

The other day I wanted to create an "annual report" to present to my daughters and former wife on father's day. i started to make a list of what what would be in a full, good and insightful report. My list - got longer and longer - see below. After a while, I added a factor in the selection which  was it has to be something about my life that I could discuss for an hour or more. And the list still got longer. I began to understand that I was creating the map described by Jorge Luis Borges in his 1946 short story ["On Exactitude in Science"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science ) - which is here in its entirety:

    …In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
    single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety
    of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the
    Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and
    which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so
    fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map
    was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the
    Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are
    Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is
    no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

    —Suarez Miranda,Viajes devarones prudentes, Libro IV,Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658

Frankly, my personal goal is to build maps that are bigger than the territory they cover, but we can cover that topic another day.

Anyway, As  I was adding topics, I decoded I needed a way of cataloging or categorizing the topics. I tried to apply my "Perceive Act Judge" ideas and this was a fail. There seemed to be no reason as to why one of these categories was better or more focussed on an activity than the others. Maslow's Hierarchy also was of little help. So then I started rummaging through my bookmarks and hit a gold mine - that hit the goal line.


[12 Life Goal Categories]( https://www.glidedesign.com/12-life-goal-categories/)

Here was a set of nouns I could relate to. Not verbs like "Perceive Act Judge" which are aspects of behaving and not adjectives such as better or worse and no project management adverbs such as before or after.

I googled "Life Goal Categories" and dozens of results arrived.  After looking at a number of them, it turns out there are many similarities. They mostly all contain something like the following list

* Career goals
* Health goals
* Family goals
* Money/financial goals
* Spiritual goals
* Personal goals

Then me being a crafty one, I moved them about into this

* Career goals
* Money/financial goals
* Health goals
* Personal goals
* Family goals
* Spiritual goals

Which then morphed into

* Doing ~ Act ~ Career goals - Money/financial goals
* Knowing ~ Perceive ~ Health goals - Personal goals
* Being ~ Judge ~ Family goals - Spiritual goals

Yay! We have a way of categorizing the what in the "who, what, when, where & why" and maybe even a bit of "how"





## Goals

this is about goals. this is not about

* Time management ~ GTD

## Big Five personality traits

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits

How do these fit in?

1. Extroversion
2. Agreeableness
3. Conscientiousness
4. Emotional Stability versus Neuroticism
5. Openness to Experience + Intellect ( Imagination )

## Myers Briggs

### Extraversion/Introversion
* The extraverted types learn best by talking and interacting with others. By interacting with the physical world, extraverts can process and make sense of new information.
* The introverted types prefer quiet reflection and privacy. Information processing occurs for introverts as they explore ideas and concepts internally.

### Sensing/Intuition

* Sensing types are good at concrete and tangible things.
* Intuitive types are good at abstract things and ideas.
* Sensing types might enjoy a learning environment in which the material is presented in a detailed and sequential manner.
* Sensing types often attend to what is occurring in the present and can move to the abstract after they have established a concrete experience.
* Intuitive types might prefer a learning atmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on meaning and associations.
* Insight is valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for intuitive types.

## Thinking/Feeling
The third continuum reflects a person's decision preferences.

* Thinking types desire objective truth and logical principles and are natural at deductive reasoning.
* Feeling types place an emphasis on issues and causes that can be personalized while they consider other people's motives.

## Judging/Perceiving
The fourth continuum reflects how a person regards complexity.
* Judging types tend to have a structured way or theory to approach the world.
* Perceiving types tend to be unstructured and keep options open.
* Judging types will always try to make accommodation between new information and their structured world, which might only be changed with discretion.
* Perceiving types will be more willing to change without having a prior structured world.
