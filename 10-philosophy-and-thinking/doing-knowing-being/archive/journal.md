A good order

Perception, Judgment and Action



### Perception

How do we know that we know?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

Holiday

* Holiday: you can control your perceptions
* Holiday: So control them well
* Holiday: See things as they really are, without ornament
* Holiday: Focus on what you can control
* Holiday: Live in the moment. There no obstacles in the present
* Holiday: See the good

* Know which biases you are in
* Know how you are being manipulated


### Judgment

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology
* value theory
* What are goals and objectives? mostly judgments
* Problem solving



### Action

Logic belongs here?
Time mostly belongs to action. Perception and Judgment are timeless
Actions are about time

Holiday:

* Bold
* Deliberate
* Persistent

SMART goals - turn judgments into effective actions
Allen's GTD



### All together now

A building is a judgment about the way thing should be

Cooking is a series of PJAs

1. We preceive that we are hungry
2. We decide to cook something
3. We search for a good recipe

Then
1 We perceive that there is a chicken in the fridge
2. We judge that a certain recipe provides a good way of cooking the chicken
3. We cook the chicken according to the recipe

and so on until we percive that we are no longer hungry

What is music?

Goals are a way of judging whether something is actionable


What is tennis? All three in quick succession.


### Carry on

Now that we have PJA as the over arching set of categories, can we further define each one so that so that we get 'better' at it?

And what is this 'better' thing anyway?





### Ideas along the way

smart goals
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria

* Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
* Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
* Assignable – specify who will do it.
* Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
* Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/smarter-living/how-to-stick-with-new-years-resolutions.html

* Specific: Set concrete, clearly defined goals with specific points of success.
* Measurable: Whatever the goal is, find ways to measure progress.
* Achievable: Aim high, but within reason. Your goal should be a stretch, but something you could actually achieve.
* Relevant: Find a goal that matters enough to you that you’ll be motivated to stick with it.
* Time-bound: Set a reasonable timeline for your goal, and focus on the small wins along the way.


problem solving

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving

* Complexity (large numbers of items, interrelations and decisions)
* Dynamics (time considerations)
* Intransparency (lack of clarity of the situation)
* Polytely (multiple goals)

LPT: If you genuinely want to know more about another person, ask them what they are passionate about . . . instead, of what they do. Often times you'll get a genuine answer and you get the added bonus of seeing them light up with energy as they describe something they actually care about.



http://recomendo.com/issues/pocket-magic-trick-minimalism-notebooks-how-to-apologize-104995

(1) Acknowledge how your action affected the person;
(2) Say you’re sorry;
(3) Describe what you’re going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Don’t excuse or explain

Perception Action Will
Perception, Action, and Judgment
Perception, Action, and Consciousness

http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html

These seem to me what philosophy should look like: quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently.

There are many philosophies but few agree.

It would be nice to have some tools that would help compare and contrast various philosophies.

There are so many ways to think about things, its probably not worth thinking about.

See Judge Act

http://vinformation.org/en/vincentian-formation-resources/presentations-media-games/the-see-judge-act-process/


The phrase OODA loop refers to the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act, developed by military strategist and United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in military operations. It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. The approach favors agility over raw power in dealing with human opponents in any endeavor.

How does semiotics affect perception?

## 2017-08-14

I had a nice, intense dialog with Andranik on the Stoics last night.

Nice thought from Andranik: The Stoic perceive, decide and act may be compared to the techie: input, process and output.


***

The more I look into historical Stoicism, the more I am bombarded by disparate, seemingly unconnected thoughts.

The more I look at Ryan Holiday's _The Obstacle is the Way_ the mor I feel at ease and ressured that there's stuff here I can understand.

And even with Holiday, I have issues. He says perceive, act, will. I prefer something like: perceive, decide, act. Rinse and repeat.

Not much here but you have to start somewhere.
