# Designing Your Life

How can design help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who or where we are, what we do or have done for a living, or how young or old we are?

The Stanford Life Design Lab applies design thinking to tackling the "wicked" problems of life and vocational wayfinding.


## [Designing Your Life | Bill Burnett | TEDxStanford]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SemHh0n19LA )

> Executive director of Stanford’s design program at the d.School, Bill Burnett uses design thinking, a career’s worth of starting companies and coaching students, and a childhood spent drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine to inform his work on how to design your life. In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement.

## Summary 1

• The problem: People tend to get stuck in life and they lack the right tools. Design Thinking (DT) is such a tool.
• Dysfunctional beliefs -> get rid of them!
    ○ You need a passion.
    ○ You should know where you're going by now.
    ○ You must become the BEST version of yourself.
        1. The unattainable best is the enemy of all the available betters.
 • 5 Tips from DT for Life Design:
    1. Connecting the dots
       i. People want their lives to be meaningful / add up to something
       ii. Exercise: Write 250 word essays on the following three questions and try to match them:
          1) Who are you (your thoughts, words, actions)?
          2) What do you believe? What's the meaning of life? The big picture? Why are you here?
          3) What do you do in the world? Why do you work? (Not a job description) The point of working?
    2. Gravity problems: If it's not actionable, it's not a problem, it's a circumstance, e. g. gravity
       i. try to reframe problems to something workable. If that doesn't work, accept them as circumstances
    3. Thought experiment: Multiverse -> How many good lives are out there for you?
       i. Exercise: Come up with 3 great five-year-from-now versions of yourself
          1) Why 3? Good quality/quantity of follow-up ideas.
          2) 3 rubrics:
             a) Your life as it is now goes great (continue what you're currently doing, trend-extrapolation)
             b) What would you do if a) died tomorrow, e. g. your job gets replaced by AI? Any sidehustle or talent to explore etc.?
             c) Wildcard-Plan: If neither $ nor reputation (nobody would laugh) was a restriction, what would you do/be? -> get creative!
          3) Goal: recognize the great oppotunities life has to offer, smartly implement insights from b) and c) into a), as they usually get left behind
    4. Prototyping your ideas
       i. Prototype to…
          1) …ask interesting questions: "What would it be like if I tried this?"
          2) …expose the underlying assumptions: "Is this even the thing I want (now) or is that just something I remember I wanted when I was 20?"
          3) …involve others with your ideas
          4) …sneak up on the future (because I don't know yet if this is exactly what I want..)
       ii. You can "prototype" ideas by…
          1) protoyping conversations: the future is already here, only unevenly distributed -> others are already living your future -> get in touch with them and learn
          2) prototyping experiences: test the experience (example: a 45 yo business exec attending a uni lecture to see if it feels right)
    5. Making better choices: How do you know when you know?
       i. The process of choosing well and making yourself happy:
          1. Gather & create options
             a) Deliberately (active brainstorming etc.)
             b) Serendipitious (be open for opportunities in your peripheral vision etc.)
          2. Narrow down options to a working list
             a) "When you have too many choices, you have no choice"
             b) Radically cross out all choices until ~7 are left (overcome FOMO!)
          3. Choose / Pick one: Combine rational judgement (pro/contra comparisons etc.) with holistic gut feelings
          4. Let go & move on instead of agonizing (FOMO strikes again!): Consider decisions irreversible
 • Simply get curious, talk to people and try stuff!
