>Google has been using E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) criteria as a means and guideline to evaluate search quality and related content since 2014. The purpose of E-A-T is to identify and distinguish high-quality content that pertains to specific search queries. Over the years, Google has become increasingly strict with the type of content that websites are allowed to produce. Search query results are becoming increasingly specialized to ensure the quality of the responses yield favourable and useful answers for users. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of misconceptions about how Google search engine E-A-T works and the role that search engine optimization (SEO) and digital marketing play.

### What is Google E-A-T?

>E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. The acronym has been around for at least 5 years, when it was firstly introduced in Version 5.0 of Google's Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines, which dates back from March 2014. These guidelines are used by search quality raters (aka search engine evaluators) to evaluate the quality of webpages and the relevance of search results.

>According to Google Rater Guidelines, E-A-T is one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an overall Page Quality rating. The other very important factors are: The Purpose of the Page, Main Content Quality and Amount, Website Information and Website Reputation.

> On Section 3.2 of the latest version of these guidelines (December 2019), Google states that "the amount of E-A-T is very important for all pages that have a beneficial purpose." The company makes a point of stressing that "there are high E-A-T pages and websites of all types, even gossip websites, fashion websites, humor websites, forum and Q&A pages, etc."

Expertise
 Raters must consider the expertise of the creator of the Main Content (MC)

Authoritativeness
 Raters must consider the authoritativeness of the creator of the MC, the MC itself, and the website

Trustworthiness
 Raters must consider the trustworthiness of the creator of the MC, the MC itself, and the website
