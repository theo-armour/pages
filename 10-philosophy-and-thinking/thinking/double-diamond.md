# Double Diamond

## Double Diamond (design process model)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)

Double Diamond is the name of a design process model popularized by the British Design Council in 2005, and adapted from the divergence-convergence model proposed in 1996 by Hungarian-American linguist Béla H. Bánáthy. The two diamonds represent a process of exploring an issue more widely or deeply (divergent thinking) and then taking focused action (convergent thinking). It suggests that the design process should have four phases:

1. Discover: Understand the issue rather than merely assuming it. It involves speaking to and spending time with people who are affected by the issues.
2. Define: The insight gathered from the discovery phase can help to define the challenge in a different way.
3. Develop: Give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people.
4. Deliver: Involves testing out different solutions at small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and improving the ones that will.


## The New Double Diamond Design Process Is Here

> The Double Diamond is no longer enough. For the past 15 years, the Double Diamond model of the design process has been the most used model to structure design projects. Or explain how the design process works to people. Or misuse to pretend design is a structured process. You can find a variation of the model on any second design slide deck or agency website. It’s origins go even further back to the divergence-convergence model proposed in 1996 by Bela Banathy. The design world has been undergoing some major shifts these past years. As more an more people are interested in how designers work and think, the inventors of the Double Diamond model thought it was about time for an update.


## Application of the Double Diamond framework to prepare the communication strategy of a great sports event

> Any sports event is characterized by the process of planning, organization and implementation and evaluation itself. This system applies to both single and repetitive, small or larger sports events. The planning process itself applies to all components – sports, technical, financial, process-law, and marketing communications.There are several marketing communication goals, but they all focus on end-users, fans, their desires, needs and interests in each sporting event. To maximize the benefits of marketing communications, careful preparation and a creative concept in the editorial plan must be prepared.Different procedures are used to prepare the communication strategy. This article aims to introduce the universal Double Diamond framework, which was used to prepare the communication strategy on the web and social medias for the World Cup in biathlon in Nové Město na Moravě held from December 20 to December 23, 2018, to familiarize with the possibilities of using social tools networks and to present the results achieved with these instruments.This study describes the framework theoretically and then shows possible practical outputs from the whole process.
