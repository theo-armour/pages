# Virtues

* Virtues are studied as potential medical diagnostic tools. They may also happen to provide a system of identifying and cataloging a spectrum of typical human organization characterizations
* Virtues are easier to apply to a group or organization that a personality traits such as Big5 or Myers Briggs
* Based on a set of universal virtues, it is easier to establish criteria as to indicators, metrics and how much of "this " virtue we actually need

And

* Would it be fun to do the same with vices - or to follow Aristotle and describe spectrums

> Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) is a book by Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman (2004) that attempts to present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical, rigorously scientific manner, intended to provide a theoretical framework for practical applications for positive psychology.[11] CSV identifies six classes of virtue (i.e. "core virtues") comprising 24 measurable "character strengths". The organization of the six virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:
>
>Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective
>Courage: bravery, persistence, integrity, zest
>Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence
>Justice: teamwork, fairness, leadership
>Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, self control
>Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

### The Criteria

What qualifies as a personal character strength, and how do you know if one is really yours? The researchers discuss many aspects of their methods and those of scientific psychology in the past.
In A Primer in Positive Psychology (2007), Peterson explains:

I believe that people possess signature strengths akin to what Allport (1961) identified decades ago as personal traits. These are strengths of character that a person owns, celebrates, and frequently exercises. In our interviews with adults, we find that almost everyone can readily identify a handful of strengths as very much their own, typically between two and five.
Peterson goes on to present a list they used in 2004 summarizing their "possible criteria for signature strengths":

* a sense of ownership and authenticity ("this is the real me") vis-a-vis the strength
* a feeling of excitement while displaying it, particularly at first
* a rapid learning curve as themes are attached to the strength and practiced
* continuous learning of new ways to enact the strength
* a sense of yearning to act in accordance with the strength
* a feeling of inevitability in using the strength, as if one cannot be stopped or dissuaded from its display
* the discovery of the strength as owned in an epiphany
* invigoration rather than exhaustion when using the strength
* the creation and pursuit of fundamental projects that revolve around the strength
* intrinsic motivation to use the strength

The list of personal character strengths is not set in stone. Like other scientific theories it is subject to change as evidence is evaluated over time. Here are the 24 strengths of character at present, grouped in 6 categories of virtues:

### Definition

CSV in its opening chapter[2] defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria:

* contributes to individual fulfillment "for oneself and others";[3]
* intrinsically valuable, in an ethical sense (gifts, skills, aptitudes, and expertise can be squandered, but character strengths and virtues cannot);
* non-rivalrous;
* not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable);
* trait-like (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time);
* not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV;
* personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.;
* observable in child prodigies (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths);
* absent in some individuals;
* and nurtured by societal norms and institutions.

### More

* CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that practicing these traits leads to increased happiness.
* Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging moral relativism and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis.
