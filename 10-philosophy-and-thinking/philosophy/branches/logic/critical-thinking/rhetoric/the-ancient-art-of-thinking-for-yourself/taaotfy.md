### The Dramatistic Pentad

The dramatistic pentad has 5 components which can be represented as questions:

* Act: What purposeful act has taken place?
* Agent: Who took this action?
* Agency: How or with what did they do it?
* Scene: Where, when and in what context did the act take place?
* Purpose: Why did they do it? What was their intent?

When applying this model to a situation, typically the purpose will be determined from an examination of the other four elements.
