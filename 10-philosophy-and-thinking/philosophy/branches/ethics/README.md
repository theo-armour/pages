## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy: Ethics

The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are

* Consequentialism, which judges actions based on their consequences. One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce.
* Deontology, which judges actions based on whether they are in accordance with one's moral duty.[130] In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences.[130]
* Virtue ethics, which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do.[130]

Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:[2]

* Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined;
* Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
* Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.


Ethics or moral philosophy is the philosophical study of moral phenomena. It investigates normative questions about what people ought to do or which behavior is morally right. It is usually divided into three major fields: normative ethics, applied ethics, and metaethics.
