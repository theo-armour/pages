# Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how we acquire it. It deals with questions such as what does it mean to know something, how do we justify our beliefs, and what are the sources and limits of knowledge

Guidelines, in brief:

* Expect good discourse to require energy.
* Don't say straightforwardly false things.
* Track (for yourself) and distinguish (for others) your inferences from your observations.
* Estimate (for yourself) and make clear (for others) your rough level of confidence in your assertions.
* Make your claims clear, explicit, and falsifiable, or explicitly acknowledge that you aren't doing so (or can't).
* Aim for convergence on truth, and behave as if your interlocutors are also aiming for convergence on truth.
* Don't jump to conclusions—maintain at least two hypotheses consistent with the available information.
* Be careful with extrapolation, interpretation, and summary/restatement—distinguish between what was actually said, and what it sounds like/what it implies/what you think it looks like in practice/what it's tantamount to. If you believe that a statement A strongly implies B, and you are disagreeing with A because you disagree with B, explicitly note that "A strongly implies B" is a part of your model.
* Allow people to restate, clarify, retract, and redraft their points, if they say that their first attempt failed to convey their intended meaning; do not hold people to the first or worst version of their claim.
* Don't weaponize equivocation/don't abuse categories/don't engage in motte-and-bailey shenanigans.
* Hold yourself to the absolute highest standard when directly modeling or assessing others' internal states, values, and thought processes.
