What are the best practices for underlining when reading when you have yellow, blue, pink, and orange highlighters?

What is a clear and clearly defined color coding underlining system with  yellow, blue, pink, and orange highlighters?

## 1. Yellow: Highlighting Key Points

Use yellow to underline

* definitions,
* critical concepts,
* key takeaways

Use yellow to underline the most critical information, such as

* main ideas
* definitions
* key concepts.

Examples:

* In history: "The Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th century."
* In science: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy."


## Blue: Supporting Details or Explanations

* Underline examples or explanations that expand on a main concept
* Use blue to underline secondary information that supports the main ideas, such as examples, explanations, or additional context.

### Examples

* In literature: Underline an example of a literary device like "The wind whispered through the trees" (personification).
* In math/science: Highlight a step in a problem-solving process or an explanation of a concept.

## Pink: Vocabulary or Key Terms

* Use pink for underlining vocabulary words, technical terms, or concepts that require memorization.


## Orange: Examples or Applications

* Use orange to underline practical applications, examples, or case studies that illustrate concepts.

Examples:

* In economics: Highlight a real-world example like "The 2008 financial crisis is an example of systemic risk."
* In physics: Underline a practical application like "Newton's laws are used in designing roller coasters."

* Yellow marks the backbone of the argument (e.g., the main thesis about climate change).
* Blue tags the factual evidence supporting that argument.
* Pink emphasizes concrete examples or definitions that illuminate key concepts.
* Orange identifies spots for reflection, inquiry, or connection to other ideas.

### **YELLOW – Main Ideas & Thesis Statements**

* **Purpose:**
  Highlight the core ideas, main arguments, or thesis statements of the text.

* **How to Use:**
  Underline or highlight sentences that summarize the central message or argument.

* **Example:**
  > “Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary drivers of global climate change.”

* **Tip:**
  Consistently use yellow to quickly spot the backbone of any argument.

### **BLUE – Supporting Details & Evidence**

* **Purpose:**
  Mark details that support the main ideas, such as facts, statistics, or quotations.

* **How to Use:**
  Highlight sentences that provide data, evidence, or elaboration on the main point.

* **Example:**
  > “A 2023 study published in *Nature* found that atmospheric CO₂ levels have risen by 30% since the industrial revolution.”

* **Tip:**
  Blue differentiates supportive information from the central thesis, making it easier to reference later.

### **PINK – Examples, Illustrations & Definitions**

* **Purpose:**
  Emphasize examples, concrete illustrations, or key definitions that clarify abstract concepts.

* **How to Use:**
  Underline instances that provide real-life examples or define important terms.

* **Example:**
  > “For instance, the rapid melting of Arctic ice is a visible indicator of rising global temperatures.”
  Or, for a definition:
  > **Definition:** *Greenhouse Effect* – The process by which greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere, warming the planet.

* **Tip:**
  Pink helps you quickly locate and review illustrative content and essential explanations.

### **ORANGE – Questions, Connections & Reflections**

* **Purpose:**
  Mark areas where you have questions, see connections to other topics, or wish to add reflections.

* **How to Use:**
  Highlight or annotate parts of the text that prompt further thought or require additional research.

* **Example:**
  > “How will advancements in renewable energy technology affect future global warming trends?”
  Or, for a connection:
  > “This reminds me of earlier discussions on sustainability in urban planning.”

* **Tip:**
  Use orange to trigger later review sessions on topics that need more exploration or critical thinking.

## **General Tips for Success:**

* **Consistency:**
  Use each color for its designated purpose every time. This consistency helps build a mental shortcut to understand your notes at a glance.

* **Create a Legend:**
  Keep a small key or legend on your notebook’s first page (or on the margins of your reading material) so you remember what each color represents.

* **Review & Revise:**
  Periodically check your notes to ensure the system remains effective for your learning style, and adjust as necessary.
