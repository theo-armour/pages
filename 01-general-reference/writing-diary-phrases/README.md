## Fakoo

* https://omniglot.com/conscripts/fakoo.htm

The Fakoo alphabet was developed from 2006 to 2008 and beyond by Alexander Fakoó as script for the blind, which can also be read by the sighted. This should enable an improved exchange of information between blind and sighted people. Inscriptions of all kinds can be read by sighted and blind people without any problems, as the characters have been adapted to the Latin letters and therefore have a high recognition value.
