## Concept

* Very much about collections, indexes, lists and categories
* The "what" and "where" of information
* Not so much about the "how" and "why"
* Very factual, explicit and detailed stuff
* About referencing


## General Reference

Access comprehensive information collections compiled for easy retrieval.

Here is a guideline and checklist for organizing the **General Reference** category of your Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, aligned with Wikipedia's categorization style.

In the Wikipedia ontology, **General Reference** is the "top-level" category for works that cover a broad range of topics or provide tools for finding information, rather than focusing on a specific subject like History or Science.

---

### **Core Philosophy: The "Meta" Container**

Think of this category as the **Librarian's Desk**. It contains the tools you use to organize, find, and define information, but rarely the deep informational content itself. If a note is about *how* to know things, or definitions that apply across all fields, it belongs here.

### **Checklist: What to Include**

Use this checklist to decide if a note or resource belongs in General Reference.

#### **1. Encyclopedic & Broad Overviews**

* [ ] **General Encyclopedias:** Links to Wikipedia itself, Britannica, or personal summaries of "everything" (e.g., "The History of the Universe" timelines).
* [ ] **Almanacs & Fact Books:** Collections of statistics, facts, and figures that span multiple domains (e.g., CIA World Factbook notes).
* [ ] **Directories:** Lists of resources, web portals, or "start pages" for your research.

#### **2. Dictionaries & Terminology**

* [ ] **Glossaries:** Definitions of terms that don't fit into a specific project (e.g., "Latin phrases used in English").
* [ ] **Thesauri:** Collections of synonyms or word maps.
* [ ] **Etymology:** Notes on the origins of words (unless specific to a field like "Medical Etymology").

#### **3. Classification & Research Methods**

* [ ] **Taxonomies:** Your own PKM structure notes, Dewey Decimal System, Library of Congress Classification summaries.
* [ ] **Research Techniques:** How to conduct a literature review, speed reading techniques, or citation guides (APA, MLA).
* [ ] **Study Skills:** Note-taking methods (Zettelkasten, SQ3R), memory palaces, or learning frameworks.

#### **4. Indices & Bibliographies**

* [ ] **Master Indices:** A "Map of Content" (MOC) that links to all other parts of your PKM.
* [ ] **Bibliographies:** Lists of books read or to-read (if they are general/mixed genre).
* [ ] **Archives:** Meta-notes about your archiving process or backup logs.

#### **5. Tools & Systems**

* [ ] **Productivity Systems:** Notes on GTD (Getting Things Done), Bullet Journaling, or Time Blocking.
* [ ] **Software Documentation:** Cheatsheets for your PKM software (Obsidian, Notion, Evernote) or general computer usage.

### **Guidance: What NOT to Include**

Do NOT Include Where it should go instead
Specific Biographies: History or People. (Unless it's a biographical dictionary).
Specific Science Facts: Natural Sciences. (e.g., "The boiling point of water" goes in Physics/Chemistry).
Fiction / Novels: Literature or Arts. (General Reference is for lists of books, not the stories themselves).
Philosophy / Beliefs: Philosophy or Religion. (Even though philosophy is broad, it is a specific discipline).
"Random" Trivia: Create a specific "Inbox" or "Trivia" folder until it can be categorized properly.
Project Plans: Projects or Task Management. (Unless it's a note about project management methodology).

The Container Test: Ask yourself, "Is this a container for information, or the information itself?"

For a personal system, context switching is the enemy. When you are looking for your templates for note-taking, you will likely also want to read that article you saved about why those templates work

### **Implementation Tips**

1. **The "000" Rule:** If you are familiar with the Dewey Decimal System, General Reference is class **000**. It is for computer science, information, and general works. If it fits there, it fits here.
2. **The Container Test:** Ask yourself, "Is this a container for information, or the information itself?"
* *A list of all capitals of the world* \rightarrow **Geography** (Information).
* *A guide on how to memorize capitals* \rightarrow **General Reference** (Study Skill/Method).
* *An atlas* \rightarrow **General Reference** (Reference Tool).



### **Example Folder Structure**

* **000 General Reference**
* `010 Bibliography` (Reading lists)
* `020 Library & Info Science` (PKM methods, Taxonomy)
* `030 Encyclopedias` (Broad wikis, Almanacs)
* `040 Unassigned` (Inbox)
* `050 Magazines & Journals` (General periodicals)
* `060 Organizations` (Associations, Foundations)
