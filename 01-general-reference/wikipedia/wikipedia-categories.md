# Wikipedia Categories


## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories

> Categories (along with other features like cross-references, lists, and infoboxes) help you to find information, even if you don't know what exists or what it's called. The following list of categories of Wikipedia's coverage parallels our other lists by topic.

>The central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to Wikipedia pages in a hierarchy of categories which readers, knowing essential—defining—characteristics of a topic, can browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics.
>
>Categories are not the only means of enabling users to browse sets of related pages. Other tools which may be used instead of or alongside categories in particular instances include lists and navigation boxes. For a comparison of these techniques, see Categories, lists and navigation templates.

This page contains guidance on the proper use of the categorization function in Wikipedia. The central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to pages in Wikipedia, in a hierarchy of categories which readers, knowing essential—defining—characteristics of a topic, can browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics.

What are categories?
* Categories allow articles to be placed in one or more groups, and allow those groups to be further categorized. An article belonging to a category should contain a link to a page that describes the category. Similarly, a sub-category belonging to a parent category should contain a link to the parent category's page.
* Each category page contains an introduction that can be edited like an article, and an automatically generated list of links to sub-categories and articles that belong to the category.
* Categories do not form a strict hierarchy or tree of categories, since each article can appear in more than one category, and each category can appear in more than one parent category. This allows multiple categorization schemes to co-exist.

Types of categories

* Topic Categories ~ singular
* Set Categories ~ plurals

>Wikipedia offers several ways to group articles: categories, list articles (including item lists, as well as topical glossary, index, outline, and timeline articles), other lists including embedded lists, and navigation templates (of which article series boxes are one type). The grouping of articles by one method neither requires nor forbids the use of the other methods for the same informational grouping. Instead, each method of organizing information has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is applied for the most part independently of the other methods following the guidelines and standards that have evolved on Wikipedia for each of these systems.
