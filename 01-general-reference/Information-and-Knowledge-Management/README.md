# Knowledge Read Me

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.

so I should definitely put in links to different note-taking systems. But where would I put articles about note-taking systems?

This is a classic taxonomist's dilemma: distinguishing between the **tool** and the **study of the tool**.

In a strict academic library (like the Dewey system), these might be separated. However, for a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, separating them often adds unnecessary friction.
### **The "Librarian's Verdict"**

**Keep them in General Reference.**

For a personal system, context switching is the enemy. When you are looking for your templates for note-taking, you will likely also want to read that article you saved about *why* those templates work.

I recommend creating a sub-category in General Reference specifically for this. You might call it:

* **020 Library & Information Science** (The Dewey standard)
* **Knowledge Management (KM)**
* **Metacognition & Methodology**

### **Revised Checklist for General Reference**

With this in mind, here is how you can organize that specific folder:

**General Reference**

**Knowledge Management (Folder)**
* [ ] **Systems:** Guides on GTD, Zettelkasten, PARA.
* [ ] **Theory (Articles):** "Why bidirectional linking matters," "The Fallacy of Folders."
* [ ] **Tools:** User manuals for Obsidian, Notion, Logseq.
* [ ] **Workflows:** Your personal checklists for how you process a book or article.
