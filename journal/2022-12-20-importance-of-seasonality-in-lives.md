# 2022-12-20 Seasonality

In _Dawn of Everything_ (DoE), Graeber and Wenger bring out the importance of seasonality to people's lives.

I had not given the concept much thought. I did know about things like this:

* SAD ~ seasonal affective disorder
* Cabin fever and seasonal mood swings
* Seasonal suicide rates
* Seasonal birth rates and related outcomes
* Spending patterns such asd Black Friday
* Halloween is the best!
* Etc

But the idea that seasonal dates may spur personal fulfillment and meaning was rather more vague to me. Easter being meaningful to a devout Christian and hateful to an anti-Christian might be as deep as I might have penetrated.

_DoE_ exposes numerous and wide-ranging possibilities as to the deep significance, the occurrence of deep changes of seasonalities to cultures past and present. Seasonality may affect fulfilling physical need, politics, sexual morays and more.


## Questions

* How are sports events and seasonality tied together?
  * The date and time are predictable; the outcome is not.
* How can I understand seasonality better and more deeply? How can I help build upon seasonality to help family life be more profound and bond-building?


## Personally

* Little need for seasonality
* At most: "Will I get a present?" "Will I have to do something?"
* I'm a "do-er". Projects get disrupted by seasons
* Seasonal events tend to be somewhat of a let-down. Outcomes are highly predictable
* My happiness is internal and spontaneous rather than planned and externally-driven
* Most people - "be-ers" - are probably not like this

>In time series data, seasonality is the presence of variations that occur at specific regular intervals less than a year, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Seasonality may be caused by various factors, such as weather, vacation, and holidaysand consists of periodic, repetitive, and generally regular and predictable patterns in the levels of a time series.

>Seasonal fluctuations in a time series can be contrasted with cyclical patterns. The latter occur when the data exhibits rises and falls that are not of a fixed period. Such non-seasonal fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions and are often related to the "business cycle"; their period usually extends beyond a single year, and the fluctuations are usually of at least two years.

>What Is Seasonality?
>Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. Any predictable fluctuation or pattern that recurs or repeats over a one-year period is said to be seasonal.
