winners game and losers game
See pro tennis and amateur tennis
Charles Ellis defines it. An excellent explanation of this concept is this: Professional tennis is a winner’s game because players try to earn points with well-designed strategies and tactics. On the other hand, in amateur tennis, the main idea is different; they try to keep the ball alive and let the opponent beat himself by making a mistake. This is a loser’s game.

>“In expert tennis the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Professional tennis players stroke the ball hard with laserlike precision through long and often exciting rallies until one player is able to drive the ball just out of reach or force the other player to make an error. These splendid players seldom make mistakes.

>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. The outcome is determined by the loser. Here’s how. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies, and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. The ball is too often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. Instead of trying to add power to our serve or hit closer to the line to win, we should concentrate on consistently getting the ball back. Amateurs seldom beat their opponents but instead beat themselves. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score because the opponent is losing even more points.”
