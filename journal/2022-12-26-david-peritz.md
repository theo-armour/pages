# 2022-12-26 Davis Peritz ~ 2022 Elections ~ why did Dss do so well

Fundamental models

inflation created 5% pay cut

Should have lost 40-60 seats

But
Trump dynamics
Supreme Court ~ Roe v Wade
Putin
Clilmate change
Jan 6 invasion


Biden very successful in his first two years - legislation accomplishments

Proviso
Elections are not a measure of public opinion

Dems
Did not lose a senate seat ~ first since ‘34
Lost 9 house ~ only

MAGA was a dragfor Rs

Every state a different story - not  national election

Redistricting mattered but not so much ~ political football
Rs receive disproportionate outcome
Less important in 2022 - less room to gerrymander
See NY & NJ power grabs

Ds did not lose a state Gov or houses
Picked up trifectas

Ds make it easier to vote

Urgent issue: climate change
Ds have done most in history

D states pushed on climate. CA’s lead helped

Election deniers ~ weak and strong

All deniers lost where it mattered

70% Rs are deniers ~ but the 30% saved us

Jan 6 committee helped

R crazies hurt ~ lost votes

Abortion varied by state

Inflation are not as outlook-changing as abortion

25% of women have abortions ~ many after having children

Uneven outcome is refreshing - not calcified
2022 indicates thaw
Less pulled by minor issues
Less partisan dominance in last 40 years
Obstruction comes to fore
Quality of candidates mattered
Much ticket splitting
Referendum on MAGA ~ but Trump not yet out ~ 2016 anomaly
Rs large turnout ~ because of Trump
Trump ~ racial politics ~ destructive
DeSantis ???
Abortion ~ not sure how much it mattered ~ Supreme Court decesions??

2024
Luster off of Trump
Biden ++
Will he run?

SC likely to reconsider many rights issues

Good future solution: Ranked choice voting
