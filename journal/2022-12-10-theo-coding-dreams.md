## Twenty Twenties

## Sectors

* CAD
* CAM
* Robotics
* City Planning
* VR / AR

  * Myths, theater, Seasonality, Role-playing, Performances, Liveness, Twitch
* Data Viz

  * Agreement & Collaboration visualization
  * APL
  * Constitutions / Rights
  * Wellness

### CAD  ~ More than digital twins

* Multi-discipline, more more addressable complexity
* Lifespan timelines
* Projects with doors and windows that open and close ~ real-time updates
* Things beyond my understanding, that only the next gen can begin to fathom

Example

* Terrain + buildings + landscape elements + air + light

Tools needed

* GitHubs for content ~ revision control in a secure cloud
* Mastodons for content ~ federated or distributed processes
* ESLint for content ~ federated error correction
* XR for content ~
* Sync content ~ pandoc ~ https://github.com/jgm/pandoc

See 2009

### Examples

### Simple

text > green === #00FF00

to

text > "dark green" === #44ffff

#### Storyboard SW example

As and when the storyboard file is updated, the continuity database, the location timeline, the costume change databases ae all updated

#### AEC example

As and when the Revit file is updated, the electrical schematic, the pipeline diagram, the Radiance SW data files are all updated.

## Twenty Teens

The things I worked included
*

* Realtime 3D map traversal
* 3D City maps with 3D terrain
* 3D Map data insertable into other 3D apps
* Realtime 3D data viz
* Easy-peasy content management
* Realtime online generative 3D art

I accomplished most of the above. My scripts are out there. The thing is that the world has caught up, people are now making a living out what I was loving. They now do it much better than I can,

## Nineties

As you saw in my demos:

* Cookie cutter architecture
* What you draw is what you get
* 3D project management
* "Rubber" (procedural) building designs
