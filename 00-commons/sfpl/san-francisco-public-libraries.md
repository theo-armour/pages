# San Francisco Public Library

## Preface ~ 2023-08-13

This is a work in progress. It is a collection of notes and links about the architecture of the San Francisco Public Library and its 27 branches.

The impetus for this project is the plan for a visit to selected libraries on August 15 2023 by a group of interested elders. My first task was to look into the libraries from Marina to Park inclusive. These library listings currently include images. Ultimately. we decided to visit the seven Carnagie libraries in San Francisco. These branches are covered in more detail in today's version.

For each of the Carnagie Libraries I looked at at least four references. To my disappointment, I found the these sources contained almost no discussion of their architectural merits.

Further efforts will include a look into the National register of Historic Places as well as articles in the press at the time of their opening.
