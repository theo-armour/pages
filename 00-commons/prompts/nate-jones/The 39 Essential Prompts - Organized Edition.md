* Support person: \[Who to talk to\]  
* Minimum viable success: \[Smallest win that counts\]

#### **Step 6: Integration Plan**

**Week 1: Evidence Gathering**

* Evening question: "How did I surprise myself today?"  
* Share with: \[Accountability person\]

**Week 2-3: Belief Practice**

---

### **Instructions**

Simplify systematically while preserving accuracy:

#### **Step 1: Concept Acknowledgment**

Confirm understanding of what needs simplifying and why (2-3 sentences).

#### **Step 2: Kid-Friendly Version**

**The Simple Explanation:**

\[Rewrite using only everyday words a 9-year-old knows. Break into short sentences. Use "you" and active voice. 100-150 words maximum.\]

**Word Swaps Made:**

* \[Complex term\] → \[Simple alternative\]  
* \[Complex term\] → \[Simple alternative\]  
* \[Complex term\] → \[Simple alternative\]

**What We Kept:** \[Any technical terms that had to stay and why\]

**Accuracy Check:** \[Confirm nothing important was lost\]

#### **Step 3: Visual Analogy**

**The Comparison:**

"\[Complex concept\] is like \[familiar everyday thing\]..."

\[Develop the analogy in 3-4 sentences, showing how the familiar thing works similarly to the complex concept. Make it visual and memorable.\]

**Why This Analogy Works:**

* Similarity 1: \[How they're alike\]  
* Similarity 2: \[Another parallel\]  
* Key difference: \[Where analogy has limits\]

**Visual Mental Image:** \[Describe what someone should picture\]

#### **Step 4: Building Blocks Approach**

**Layer 1: Core Concept** (Everyone understands) \[One sentence with the absolute basics\]

**Layer 2: How It Works** (Most people follow) \[2-3 sentences adding the mechanism\]

**Layer 3: Why It Matters** (Practical application) \[2-3 sentences on real-world impact\]

**Layer 4: Deeper Details** (For those who want more) \[Optional complexity for curious readers\]

**Comprehension Checkpoint Questions:** After Layer 1: "Got it so far?" After Layer 2: "Make sense how that works?" After Layer 3: "See why this matters?"

#### **Step 5: Real-World Examples**

**Example 1: Personal/Everyday** *Scenario:* \[Relatable situation\] *How concept applies:* \[Show it in action\] *What happens:* \[Outcome they'd experience\]

**Example 2: Business/Work** *Scenario:* \[Professional context\] *How concept applies:* \[Practical use\] *Benefit:* \[Why they'd care\]

**Example 3: Future/Aspirational** *Scenario:* \[What becomes possible\] *How concept enables:* \[The cool factor\] *Impact:* \[Why it's exciting\]

#### **Step 6: Memory Aids**

**Acronym/Mnemonic:** \[If applicable \- create memorable device\]

**One-Liner Summary:** \[10 words max that capture essence\]

**Story Version:** \[50-word mini narrative that embeds the concept\]

**Visual Sketch Idea:** \[Simple drawing they could make\]

#### **Step 7: Common Misunderstandings**

**What People Often Think:** \[Misconception\] **Why That's Not Right:** \[Simple correction\] **Better Way to Think:** \[Accurate simple version\]

\[Repeat for 2-3 common confusions\]

* Option A impact: \[How this shapes growth\]  
* Option B impact: \[How this shapes growth\]  
* Which leads to more growth: \[Analysis\]

**Question 2: About Relationships and Impact** *"Did my choice strengthen the relationships that mattered and create positive impact?"*

* Option A impact: \[Effect on relationships/legacy\]  
* Option B impact: \[Effect on relationships/legacy\]  
* Which serves others better: \[Analysis\]

**Question 3: About Authenticity and Values** *"Did I choose based on my true values or on fear/external pressure?"*

* Option A motivation: \[What's driving this choice\]  
* Option B motivation: \[What's driving this choice\]  
* Which aligns with core values: \[Analysis\]

#### **Step 3: Path Evaluation Framework**

Score each option (1-10) on:

**Growth Potential**

* Option A: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]  
* Option B: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]

**Relationship Impact**

* Option A: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]  
* Option B: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]

* Option B: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]

**Regret Risk**

* Option A: \[Score \- higher \= more regret\] \- \[Why\]  
* Option B: \[Score\] \- \[Why\]

**Reversibility**

* Option A: \[Can you change course? How hard?\]  
* Option B: \[Can you change course? How hard?\]

#### **Step 4: The 80-Year-Old Test**

* **Not trying:** \[Which option represents playing it safe\]  
* **Not being true to yourself:** \[Which option is inauthentic\]  
* **Prioritizing fear over growth:** \[Which is fear-based\]

* **Investing in relationships and experiences**

Hidden factors to consider:

* Compound effects over \[time horizon\] years  
* Who you'll become through each choice  
* Doors that open/close with each path

#### **Step 5: Letter from Future You**

*\[Write a 150-200 word letter from your future self, with the wisdom of hindsight, addressing your current self's decision. Include what mattered most, what didn't matter at all, and what you wish you'd known.\]*

#### **Step 6: Decision Framework**

Based on this analysis:

**Recommended Choice:** \[Option A/B/C\]

**Why this minimizes future regret:**

1. \[Reason based on growth\]  
2. \[Reason based on values\]  
3. \[Reason based on impact\]

**How to proceed:**

* First step: \[Concrete action\]  
* Key milestone: \[3-month checkpoint\]  
* Pivot option: \[If/when to reconsider\]

**Regret Insurance:**

* Document why you chose this path  
* Set review dates to adjust course  
* Build in flexibility where possible
