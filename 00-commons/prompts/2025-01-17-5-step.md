The same tool in the hands of different persons can work different levels of wonder.

It happened with Googling. It is happening with conversational AIs.

While Google is available to everyone, not all of us know how to use it to get answers in a timely, precise, and efficient manner.

There’s an art to Googling and those who know the art have an edge over those who don’t:

They get answers faster than everyone else
They know how to cut out search results that’re irrelevant to their queries
They get deeper and more quality search results
This same thing is happening with chatbots.

Some use surface-level prompts, and what they get are mediocre and generic responses. Those skilled in prompt engineering milk the entire thing.

I know a few Googling tricks, and when conversational AI exploded in 2022, I wanted to know the nuts and bolts of getting the right response so I could attain an edge.

Here are the two ways I have used ChatGPT so far:

Ask it to generate a good prompt for me that I’d later feed back to it for quality response
Craft my own prompt using what I have learned about prompt engineering over time.
I have used both methods enough that I now understand the structure of a good prompt.

A good prompt typically gives ChatGPT:

* Role
* Context
* Task
* Style
* Format

I call it the five-step prompting technique.


## Role
A doctor writing about a disease will do so differently from a layman writing about the same disease.

The doctor knows the right terms for descriptions, and can better alley the fears and hopes around the disease.

Giving ChatGPT a role is telling it who to pose as, and that can dramatically change what and how it writes.

Here are different roles you can ask it to assume depending on what you want it to write:

For social media calendars/posts, you can ask it to pose as an expert content strategist
Ask it to pose as an SEO expert for content calendar/blog posts for your blog
For business writing you can ask it to pose as a business strategist
Ask it to pose as an expert copywriter when you want it to write sales copies.
The deal is to find out the professional title for the work you’re requesting, then ask it to assume that role when giving its response.

## Context
There are many reasons why we create content. We do it to inform, persuade, entertain, instruct, or influence the reader to take action.

The reason why we create content shapes what we say and how we say them. Whether you will appeal to your readers’ emotions or their intellect depends entirely on what you want to achieve. And this, in turn, determines your choice of words.

When you give ChatGPT context — what you want to achieve, you’re invariably instructing it to be mindful that what it says, and how it says them, is aimed at achieving your intended purpose.

Not doing this is like starting a journey with no destination in mind.

## Task
This is where you say what you want.

It is where everyone else starts and stops when they ask ChatGPT to do something, so stressing it is of little use.

But one thing: when you give ChatGPT a task, let’s say you want it to generate some texts, don’t just tell it what to write, rather, you can also mention specific aspects of a given topic that you want it to cover.

So rather than just ask it to create a post about personal finance, you can equally require it to touch on “the hidden cost of savings” and “why it is important to prioritize investing over savings.”

If there’s the chance that ChatGPT will regurgitate the same content for everyone who asks it to write on personal finance, adding areas of focus is how you get it to add something unique to the mix.

## Style
Styling is everything. You should learn how to use it.

Whenever I need ChatGPT to generate a salescopy for me, I usually ask it to follow the PAS copywriting technique. That’s my preferred style for writing salescopies.

Do you know of any other copywriting techniques? You can use it.

This, however, is just one aspect of styling.

You can also specify the tone you want ChatGPT to use —it can be friendly, professional, funny, etc.

If there is a writing style or principles you like, see some examples here, you can also ask it to include them.

## Format
Have you ever had ChatGPT give you a concise response when you needed something more in-depth, or perhaps it goes on to ramble, churning out a full-blown article whereas you only wanted a simple explanation?

This happens, but you can control this in your prompt by asking ChatGPT to be concise, elaborate, or by specifying a particular word count you want it to aim at.

You can also specify if you want your response to have bullet points, or not, and how many paragraphs you want the output to be.

## Wrapping up
What prompt engineering is teaching us is that AI use don’t just end in telling them what we want them to generate.

We can shape the output a bit more, by specifying the role we want it to assume, giving it context, the task, specifying a style and also a format.

This way we greatly influence the quality of the output we get from these chatbots.
