Research and help me improve my ways of cataloging the files that I write and the information that I tag which is all based on the Wikipedia categorization system.

I use Wikipedia categories as a method for categorizing the information I store and markdown files I create. Here is a link to some of my prime sources.

I use this system because it is obviously very widely used.
I have not been able to think of a better system For a simple-minded person like myself
I feel that it's something that other people could pick up and understand easily as well.
