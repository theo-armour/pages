I am at a loss for words.

It's so the future.

It's so 1980s.

Random Bullet Points

* How could the packaging that is so complex and detailed be so weird?
* The packaging uses pull off strips so that once you open it you can't put it back together so it closes the loop on reuse.
* Were the packaging designers American who are incompetent or were they Chinese who are intentionally making it hard?
* Somehow while getting it out of the case, I must have flipped a tiny switch and turned the whole thing off.
* The whole ride back from the Best Buy was spent trying to figure out how to turn it back on.
* Ditto the first half hour back home.
* Then I found the switch
* Do you remember trying to install an old-timey printer?
* TL;DR: I got it going (but I felt like Jerry Pournelle in the old days of Byte Magazine)
* The wrist band is marketed as a huge feature but not for one-handed peeps.
* So the next thing I played with is all the swipe and gripes, er taps stuff.
* At least I can get it to work with one hand (mostly)
* And then onto the User Interface of the future: voice!
* I have to say that the voice recognition is pretty good.
* And a lot of command and control stuff is available
* But quite a bit of the advertised stuff is not available yet.
* I have to say that the display is pretty good.
* More soon
