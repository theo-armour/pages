## Meta Ray-Ban Design Flaws

## Gripe #1
The design process for the glasses was obviously started years ago, well before the wristband was thought of, well before voice dictation worked properly, well before AI was doing amazing things.

There had been VR and XR glasses, and they almost all had swiping and buttons on the frames. So, of course, this user interface had to be supported.

There also had been systems that recognized gestures, but they were not reliable.

But the meta designers were looking for something. So the wristband concept was brought into play.

And then, more recently, the voice and voice-to-text were brought into play. But it seems almost an afterthought.

## Gripe #2 Walled Garden

In order to use the glasses, you need to use the Meta app, and the Meta app is basically a meta-walled garden giving access only to Meta apps.

Cannot send an email.

Cannot watch YouTube video.

## Gripe #3 AI not as smart as some

The voice recognition is pretty good, but the AI is not as smart as some.
