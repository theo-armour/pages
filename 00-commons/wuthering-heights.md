# Wuthering Heights

## 2026-02-04

I took my walk and started _Wuthering Heights_. Many descriptions that seem unreal, Not something that would happen in real life somehow. Self-indulgent. Intropective solipsistic?

Given the book's popularity, I guess many people are like that.

And then Mr. Lockwood choosing to live in a grim place, so that it would match his grim character.

I should probably also get the kindle version and have a look at the Wikipedia summary.
