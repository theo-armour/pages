### Prompt

Generate new product ideas with the following requirements: The product will target [market or customer]. It should be a [pick: physical good/service/software], not a [pick: physical good/service/software]. I'd like a product that could be sold at a retail price of less than about [insert amount].
The ideas are just ideas. The product need not yet exist, nor may it necessarily be clearly feasible. Follow these steps. Do each step, even if you think you do not need to. First generate a list of 100 ideas (short title only). Second, go through the list and determine whether the ideas are different and bold, modify the ideas as needed to make them bolder and more different. No two ideas should be the same. This is important! Next, give the ideas a name and combine it with a product description. The name and idea are separated by a colon and followed by a description. The idea should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. Do this step by step.
