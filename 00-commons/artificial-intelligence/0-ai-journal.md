### #2

Role: You are an OCR expert.

Input: A PDF made of images of a spreadsheet export.

Goal: Extract ONLY numeric cell values from rows whose FIRST COLUMN "matches closely" one of these labels:

- Numeric value representing the year
- Opening Assets
- Money Added/Withdrawn
- Management Fees
- Money Earned
- Net Assets
- Return

Label-matching (strict but fuzzy):

- Case-insensitive; ignore spaces and punctuation.
- Accept common variants (e.g., "Mgmt Fees", "Management Fee", "Net Asset(s)", "Opening Balance/Assets", "Contributions/Withdrawals", "Money Added or Withdrawn", "Earnings/Return").
- Or accept edit distance ‚â§ 2 from any target label after normalization.
- If multiple labels match a row, choose the best (lowest distance); break ties by the listed order above.

Row/column selection:

- Ignore rows with mostly text (i.e., <30% numeric cells), rows with no values, and rows containing footnotes or superscript markers.
- Ignore columns that are empty or have <10% numeric cells across the sheet.

Normalization of numbers:

- Strip `$`, `%`, and `,`.
- Treat parentheses/brackets as negatives: "(1,234)" or "[1,234]" => -1234.
- Treat trailing minus as negative: "1234-" => -1234.
- Convert all outputs to numeric type (floats/ints as appropriate).
- Treat blanks, "‚Äî", "-", "n/a", "NA" as missing (omit from output).

Quality:

- Preserve original column order.
- Check that values are in their correct year column
- Enforce consistent typing; reject cells that fail numeric parse.
- Rescale percentages; just Remove the `%` symbol; retain decimal point.

Output:

- CSV with VALUES ONLY (no headers, no labels, no commentary).
- Include only rows that matched the target labels after normalization.

üé® Design Prompt ‚Äî French Wine-&-Cheese Tasting Flyer
(8.5 √ó 11 in portrait, with 0.125 in bleed on all sides)

Visual style: channel Pierre-Auguste Renoir‚Äôs soft, luminous brushwork and convivial garden-party scenes. Warm Impressionist light; delicate, rounded forms; subtle texture that feels hand-painted.

Color palette: deep ‚Äúbleu, blanc et rouge‚Äù‚Äînavy-ink blue, ivory-white highlights, rich burgundy reds that echo good Bordeaux. Let the burgundy accentuate wine elements while blue/white balance the composition.

Background concept: an airy French courtyard or orchard at dusk‚Äîblurred figures clinking glasses, leafy boughs catching late sun, dappled shadows. Keep details impressionistic so text remains the focal point.

Typography (all text center-aligned in a translucent, parchment-tinted overlay band):
1. Headline (largest, Didot or elegant high-contrast serif):
   Taste Wines & Cheeses from France
2. Sub-headline (flowing script, arching slightly above):
   Vive la France !
3. Event line (medium serif, small caps):
   Wednesday, July 16 at 3 PM ‚Äì Friendship Hall
4. Tasting note (smaller italic):
   Flights of Four Wines √ó Four Cheeses
5. Footer (smallest, light italic with centred tilde):
   $20 Donation ~ Limited to 16 tasters

Graphic touches: faint wine-ruby brushstrokes framing the text block; a subtle navy border just inside the bleed; light ivory filigree separators. No logo space.

Output: high-resolution (‚â• 300 DPI) PDF and PNG, CMYK color, full-bleed (final trim 8.5 √ó 11 in). Ensure safe-zone margins so no text is trimmed.
