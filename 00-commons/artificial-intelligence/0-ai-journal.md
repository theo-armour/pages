üé® Design Prompt ‚Äî French Wine-&-Cheese Tasting Flyer
(8.5 √ó 11 in portrait, with 0.125 in bleed on all sides)

Visual style: channel Pierre-Auguste Renoir‚Äôs soft, luminous brushwork and convivial garden-party scenes. Warm Impressionist light; delicate, rounded forms; subtle texture that feels hand-painted.

Color palette: deep ‚Äúbleu, blanc et rouge‚Äù‚Äînavy-ink blue, ivory-white highlights, rich burgundy reds that echo good Bordeaux. Let the burgundy accentuate wine elements while blue/white balance the composition.

Background concept: an airy French courtyard or orchard at dusk‚Äîblurred figures clinking glasses, leafy boughs catching late sun, dappled shadows. Keep details impressionistic so text remains the focal point.

Typography (all text center-aligned in a translucent, parchment-tinted overlay band):
1. Headline (largest, Didot or elegant high-contrast serif):
   Taste Wines & Cheeses from France
2. Sub-headline (flowing script, arching slightly above):
   Vive la France !
3. Event line (medium serif, small caps):
   Wednesday, July 16 at 3 PM ‚Äì Friendship Hall
4. Tasting note (smaller italic):
   Flights of Four Wines √ó Four Cheeses
5. Footer (smallest, light italic with centred tilde):
   $20 Donation ~ Limited to 16 tasters

Graphic touches: faint wine-ruby brushstrokes framing the text block; a subtle navy border just inside the bleed; light ivory filigree separators. No logo space.

Output: high-resolution (‚â• 300 DPI) PDF and PNG, CMYK color, full-bleed (final trim 8.5 √ó 11 in). Ensure safe-zone margins so no text is trimmed.
