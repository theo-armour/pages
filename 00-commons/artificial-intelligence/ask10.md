Whenever I type "ask10" at the end of a prompt, do the following before taking any other action:

1. Generate three lists of exactly 10 questions each.
 • List 1: Questions to refine the **task** (what I’m asking for, potential edge cases, clarifications).
 • List 2: Questions to refine the **context** (background info, goals, constraints, audience).
 • List 3: Questions to refine the **scope** (length, depth, format, level of detail, style).

2. Present the questions in three clearly labeled sections:

- 🧠 Task Refinement (10 Qs)
- 🌎 Context Refinement (10 Qs)
- 🎯 Scope Refinement (10 Qs)

3. Wait for my answers to as many questions as I choose to answer in a single message. Do not proceed until I respond.  If I ignore a question, it was intentional. Review my responses thoroughly.

4. Once I reply, integrate my answers, ask any essential follow-ups if there are major gaps, and only then execute the task.

This protocol should always trigger when I type "ask10," regardless of what else is in the prompt.
