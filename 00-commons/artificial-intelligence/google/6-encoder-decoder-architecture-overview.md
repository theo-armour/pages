# Encoder-Decoder Architecture

This course gives you a synopsis of the encoder-decoder architecture, which is a powerful and prevalent machine learning architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. You learn about the main components of the encoder-decoder architecture and how to train and serve these models. In the corresponding lab walkthrough, youâ€™ll code in TensorFlow a simple implementation of the encoder-decoder architecture for poetry generation from the beginning.

Objectives

* Understand the main components of the encoder-decoder architecture.
* Learn how to train and generate text from a model by using the encoder-decoder architecture.
* Learn how to write your own encoder-decoder model in Keras.
