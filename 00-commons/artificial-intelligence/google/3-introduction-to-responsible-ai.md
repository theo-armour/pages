# Introduction to Responsible AI

Objectives

* Understand why Google has put AI principles in place.
* Identify the need for a responsible AI practice within an organization.
* Recognize that decisions made at all stages of a project have an impact on responsible AI.
* Recognize that organizations can design AI to fit their own business needs and values.

## Video

* Developing responsible AI requires an understanding of the possible issues, invitations, or unintended consequences.

7 Principles

1. AI should be socially beneficial.

Any project should take into account a broad range of social and economic factors, and we'll

proceed only where we believe that the overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.

2. AI should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.

We seek to avoid unjust effects on people, particularly those related to sensitive characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief.

3. AI should be built and tested for safety.

We will continue to develop and apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of home.

4. AI should be accountable to people.

We will design AI systems that provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal.

5. AI should incorporate privacy design principles.

We will give opportunity for notice and consent, encourage architectures with privacy safeguards, and provide appropriate transparency and control over the use of data.

6. AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence.

We will work with a range of stakeholders to promote thoughtful leadership in this area, during on scientifically rigorous and multi-disciplinary approaches.

We will responsibly share AI knowledge by publishing educational materials, best practices, and research thus enable more people to develop useful AI applications.

7. AI should be made available for uses that accord with these principles. Many technologies have multiple uses. We'll work to limit potentially harmful or abusive applications.

In addition to these seven principles, there are certain AI applications that we will not pursue.

We will not design or deploy AI in these four application areas:

* Technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.
* Weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.
* Technologies that gather or use information for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms
* technologies whose purpose contravene is widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.
