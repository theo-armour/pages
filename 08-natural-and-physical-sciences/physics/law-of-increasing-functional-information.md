This “Law of Increasing Functional Information” posits that if configurations of any system undergo selection for a particular function, evolution happens. Such a discovery reframes our understanding of the universe, from the origins of life to the properties of stars

1. The new law recognizes evolution as a feature of all natural world’s complex systems, not just life.
2. Systems, both living and nonliving, evolve when a configuration enhances function.
3. This law complements existing laws, like the 2nd law of thermodynamics, by focusing on the increase of functional information in evolving systems.

## Scientists and philosophers identify nature's missing evolutionary law

## Selection for function
The new work presents a modern addition—a macroscopic law recognizing evolution as a common feature of the natural world's complex systems, which are characterized as follows:

* They are formed from many different components, such as atoms, molecules, or cells, that can be arranged and rearranged * repeatedly
* Are subject to natural processes that cause countless different arrangements to be formed
Only a small fraction of all these configurations survive in a process called "selection for function."

all systems:

1. Stay stable for some time.
2. Can change into many forms but remain steady.
3. Create entirely new setups over time.

## The Law of Increasing Functional Information

* The functional information of a system will increase (i.e., the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system are subjected to selection for one or more functions.
