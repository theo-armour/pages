## Observations

### Ambience

* Anonymous city living
* Polk Street and civic center both accessible by foot

### Architecture
* Highly reminiscent of a John Portman product
* Or _Ville Radieuse_
* Much patterned RC gives a strong brutalist feeling
* Elevators system: too complicated ~ out of date
* Lack of ventilation highly evident and felt
* Top floor 26th ~ a loss
  * Meeting rooms with blinds
  * Wall of windows with wind tunnel inside
* Not much art
* Lots of public areas ~ few people evident
* No peeps with their laptops
* Where to get a cup of coffee?
* No easy connection with the outside areas
* Atrium: no views of gardens


### Dining

* Cafeteria system ~ still a mystery to me: must take hours to get your food
* Many salad choices visible ! bit nowhere near our salad choices
* No flowers on the tables
* Looks like tables only used once

### Gift Shop

* All snacks were unhealthy junk food

### Auditorium

* Seats OK - but not comfy looking
* Had large ventilation device

### Library

* lots of magazines
* No comfy place to sit
