A Brilliant MIT Professor Shared 10 Simple Rules That Will Teach You How to Give a Great SpeechIn a lecture that's been viewed over 13 million times, MIT professor Patrick Winston revealed 10 great secrets to giving a great speech.

In a recorded lecture that's been viewed over 13 million times, MIT professor Patrick Winston takes a deep dive into how to be a better speaker. He explains that your success in life depends on your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas -- in that order.

His point? No matter how amazing your ideas are, no one cares unless you can convey them in a clear, compelling manner -- and with emotional intelligence.

Fortunately, you don't need an MIT education to become a highly skilled communicator. Whether you're an entrepreneur, business owner, or leader, these 10 rules will help you improve your ability to communicate in critical situations. (If you enjoyed these lessons, be sure to sign up for my free emotional intelligence course, where every day for seven days you get a different rule designed to help you develop your own emotional intelligence.)

Rule 1: Offer an empowerment promise
When you start to speak, Winston says, you need to grab (and keep) your audience's attention. The best way to do that?

An empowerment promise.

An empowerment promise is a simple statement that clearly explains what the audience can learn from you and why they should care. For example, in his lecture Winston promises students that they'll learn skills in the next 60 minutes that will make a real difference in their lives.

Use an empowerment promise to explain to your listeners exactly what you can teach them, how they will benefit, and why it's important.

Rule 2: Cycle the subject
Once you've captured the attention of your audience, you need to keep it as you build a strong argument for your main point.

The first way to do that is through cycling. You'll circle back to your main point at least three times during your presentation, using repetition for emphasis. You might have heard similar (wise) advice to tell your audience what you want to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them.

Why is this so important? "Well, there are many reasons," explains Winston, "one of which is, at any given moment, about 20 percent of you will be fogged out no matter what the [topic]. So, if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times."

Rule 3: Build a fence
Next, you'll build a fence around your idea in a way that distinguishes it from other ideas (and helps your audience avoid confusion).

For example, you might acknowledge that there are similar products to yours on the market, but yours is unique because of x, y, and z. Or you might reference established research on a certain topic, but you'll build your fence by examining the topic from a different perspective.

Rule 4: Use verbal punctuation
No matter how skilled a speaker you are, it's inevitable that some of your audience members' minds will start to wander.

Verbal punctuation, that is, giving a brief summary of what you've covered so far, invites the audience to refocus on your presentation. Do this every 5-10 minutes to ensure everybody stays with you.

Rule 5: Ask a question
Another way to help your audience "get back on the bus" is to ask a question.

Avoid asking a question that's so simple someone would be embarrassed to answer it. At the same time, you should also avoid asking a question so difficult that no one will be brave enough to answer it.

And once you ask the question, don't be afraid of a little awkward silence, says Winston. In fact, he says you can wait up to seven seconds before moving forward -- that's enough time to get everyone's attention.

Rule 6: Choose the right time and place
You can't expect to capture the attention of your listeners if they're sleepy or sluggish.

If possible, choose a time mid-to-late morning when your audience is most likely to be alert and receptive. It's also vital to speak in a well-lit room, as dim lighting leads to drowsiness and mental fog.

Rule 7: Use boards, props, and slides
The medium(s) you use to present your ideas play a major role in how engaged your listeners become -- and how much information they retain.

When teaching or informing, Winston prefers using some type of board, because the speed you write on a board is approximately the same speed that your listeners can absorb ideas. Watching someone write also activates the brain's "mirror neurons," which increases the chances of your audience remembering your main points.

Additionally, Winston says props are great because they get everyone in the room to watch closely.

How can you apply this rule during your next presentation? Write key words and phrases on boards when you can, and use slides, props, and graphics to support and solidify those main ideas. Avoid cramming too many images or lengthy blocks of text on your visual elements.

Rule 8: Inform and inspire
The most effective communicators know that simply conveying information isn't enough. They also need to inspire their audience to take action.

In his lecture, Winston explains that people feel most inspired when they witness someone who's passionate about what they're doing. In other words, your enthusiasm (or lack thereof) is contagious to your listeners.

Whether you're talking about an innovative idea, a new product, or groundbreaking research, be enthusiastic. Start with your empowerment promise; then, inspire and motivate by delivering on that promise.

Rule 9: Facts and figures help, but persuade with stories
According to Winston, you have no more than five minutes to convince the listener that your ideas are worthy of their time and attention. Your audience must also be convinced that you've done something to try to bring that vision to life. To do this, you'll need more than dry data.

But as Winston explains, one thing that sets us apart from animals is our ability to string ideas together into a story. Compelling storytelling not only drives home the main points but also persuades and convinces your audience that you've done something worthy of their consideration.

So remember: Facts and figures win minds, but stories win hearts.

Rule 10: How to conclude: Salute the audience
Your introduction and the way you build your argument are important, but your audience is more likely to remember your conclusion than any other part of your speech.

And as the famous expression goes: People may not remember what you said, but they will remember the way you made them feel.

For that reason, Winston recommends that after you summarize your take, you salute the audience -- that is, you tell the audience how much you value their time and attention and what it says about them.

To illustrate, here's how Winston ended his lecture:

"You know what? I'm glad you're here. And the reason is, by being here, I think you have demonstrated an understanding that how you present and how you package your ideas is an important thing. And I suggest that you come back again and bring your friends."

A conclusion like this will help your audience not only remember you, but the way you made them feel -- which will only leave them hungry for more.
