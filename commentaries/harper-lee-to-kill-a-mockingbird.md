* 1960
* Harper Lee and Truman Capote
* Peck's grandson was named "Harper" in her honor
* Harper Lees never really writes another book
* Early comment by Tay Hohoff: "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel."
* Lee modeled the character of Dill on Truman Capote
* It is considered by some to be the "Great American Novel"
* "repository of cracker-barrel epigrams" and the novel represents a "sugar-coated myth" of Alabama history.
* forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them
* The New York Times announced To Kill a Mockingbird as the best book of the past 125 years on December 28, 2021

Review by leynes

>I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.
>
>And that really infuriates me. This book was written by a white woman, from a white perspective, about white characters, for a white audience. This book is a pat on the back for the white middle class. This book gives comfort to the white middle class. Comfort that they, especially back in the 1960s, didn't need, and allow me to be so bold, didn't deserve.

Yup...

The play _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was quite wonderful

At the Golden Gate Theater
* With Bernie, Leslie and Wendy
* Audience very old
* Pizza after at MonteSacro

Comments

* Mary Badham, an Oscar nominee for playing Scout in the 1962 To Kill a Mockingbird film, as Mrs. Dubose.
* Highly complex choreography
* Many frequent scene changes
* Like TV? ADHD friendly?
* Colors subdued
* Many lines sounded like they could be quotable
* It's a compendium of things we know about the South
* A string of precious vignettes
* It is not a deep play in a literary sense
* Scout was wonderful
* Bounced from narrator to participant effortlessly
* The ending was tangled in two ways
* At one point, I/we thought the play was over - and applauded as such
* The are references to bible text - that had not really occurred elsewhere
* Theater nowadays is more thrilling than ever
