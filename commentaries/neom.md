## My thoughts

Centrally planned communities where jobs, housing, education, health are all under the management of a single organization tend to have issues. Communist (with a small c ) entities are far and few between but the US Navy and other country-sponsored centrally-planned entities seem to prevail and some would say even prosper. Clones of Dubai or Singapore might lead to good things maybe.

I heart the investment in infrastructure technology. On the other hand I see no mention of better design and build tools. Bechtel as construction lead is kind of old-school.

The straight line format is an issue. Ditto circular buildings. See CGD, Apple HQ, [Pasadena Art Center]( http://www.artcenter.edu/ ). Getting from one end to the other is an issue. Better example: Do what railroads do: follow the terrain in a linear manner, go where it's flat. Go where there are views. Go where people want to get to 
Deeper thoughts

By spreading the people out along a line you reduce the possibilities for congregation. You thus create a continuous suburb. Suburbs full of middle class people mortgaged up to the hilt are much easier to manage than pockets of throbbing urban gristle. 

BTW, we have a similar development in the US. Route 99 in California's Central Valley from Sacramento to Bakersfield is a continuous strip of conjoined minor cities. But a comparison would likely be off-topic.
Apart from Celebration Fl, another comparable may be Google's [Smart City]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk_Toronto ) in Toronto. The current paranoias regarding surveillance caused it to fail.  It will be interesting to see if Neom is too big to fail.
