At your talk at Heritage on the Marina on August 26, you presented a host of issues that may serve to confound life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

When asked what could be done to alter the course of events, you suggested "regulate media"

I am totally with you that media is the disruptor, but I have difficulty imagining ways that media could be regulated.

Rather than turning way, might it be fruitful to to examine the current state of media and identify where things might be un-dissembled?

What are three (five? seven? ) global trends that currently appear to underlie major shifts in the way people collaborate?

Is this a thing: Interpersonal communication is shifting from media that involves writing, silence, static printed text content to media that produces oral, aural, reactive and graphical content. Peeps like Marshal McLuhan and Zeynep Tufekci may be sources of inspiration.

The ethos of conservation is getting a lot of press these days. We read about Sustainable Development Goals, Effective Altruism, the Long Now. Are they fashion? Or do they have traction?

If you are interested, I will be please to double-click into any of these topics over a periods of several weeks and report
