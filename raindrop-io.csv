644955656,These 38 Reading Rules Changed My Life - RyanHoliday.net,,"It’s a weird thing to say, but I guess I’m a professional reader. That’s really what authors are. A book is made of books. “The greatest part of a writer’s time is spent in reading; a man will turn over half a library to make one book,” Samuel Johnson said. I’ve written 15 books now, which has meant reading many thousands of books in the process. Once a month for the last 15 years, I’ve recommended many of those books in the Reading List Email. And in 2021, I opened my own bookstore filled with my all-time favorites. So the question I am asked most often is: How do you read so much? What’s the secret? The answer is not “I’m a speedreader.” As I’ve written before, speed reading is a scam. The answer is that I have a system, a process that helps me be a productive reader. It’s not my system exactly, as I’ve taken many strategies from history’s greatest readers. Nor is this a system designed around speed or quantity. Reading is wonderful in and of itself, why would I try to rush through it? No, I try to do it well. I try to enjoy it. In this email, I thought I would detail some of the rules I’ve come to follow over the years. They don’t all make me faster, but they do make me better. –Do it all the time. Bring a book with you everywhere. I’ve read at the Grammy’s and in the moments before going under for a surgery. I’ve read on planes and beaches, in cars and in cars while I waited for a tow truck. You take the pockets of time you can get. –Physical books only. -It’s not that I have a problem with audiobooks–if it gets you reading, I’m all for it. I just think there’s something very special about the physical form. I just read a great book about this actually called Proust and the Squid by Maryanne Wolf. –Hardcover over paperback. –Bring a pen with you too. Reading is better if you’re taking notes. –Keep a commonplace book. As Seneca wrote: “We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application—not far far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech—and learn them so well that words become works.” (Here’s a video on my commonplace book method). –Err on the side of age. Classics are classics for a reason. -Beat them up. Books are not precious things. As an author, I love it when people hand me a book to sign that has had real miles put on it. When people hand me a pristine copy and tell me it’s their favorite, I assume they are just flattering me. It’s obvious what my favorite books are…because they’re falling apart (here’s my copy of Meditations for instance). –In every book you read, try to find your next one in its footnotes or bibliography. This is how you build a knowledge base in a subject—it’s how you trace a subject back to its core. -Same goes when you find an author you love, read them ALL. I read Cecil Woodham-Smith’s book on the charge of the Light Brigade…only to find she had also written a biography of Florence Nightingale. It was that discovery that shaped a full third of my book Courage is Calling. -That comment from (the disgraced and indicted FTX founder) Sam Bankman Fried about how every book could be a 900 word blog post is preposterously stupid. The whole point of reading is to really understand something. So if all you’re after is the ‘gist,’ skip books and stick with blog posts. –If you see a book you want, just buy it. Don’t worry about the price. Reading is not a luxury. It’s not something you splurge on. It’s a necessity. Even if all you get is one life-changing idea from a book, that’s still a pretty good ROI. -That might sound privileged, but Warren Buffett considers the foundation of his multi-billion dollar empire to be a book. At 19-years-old, he bought a copy of The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. We don’t know exactly what he paid for it, but in the early 1950s, a hardcover typically went for $1.30–the best investment he ever made, he’s said. Today, Buffett’s worth $108.7 billion, having given away some $37 billion to charitable causes. Not a bad ROI! –Some people might recoil at categorizing a book that way, but as a lover of literature, I have no problem with it. I myself wouldn’t be writing this to you today if I hadn’t bought a paperback of Meditations in 2006 for $8.25 on Amazon. That book of philosophy taught me not just about life, but also schooled me in the art of writing, in working with and managing people, and gave me the speciality which I now write my own books about. Again, not a bad ROI. –Don’t just read books, re-read books. There’s a great line the Stoics loved—that we never step in the same river twice. The books don’t change, but you do. –As I said, speed reading is a scam. You just have to spend a lot of time reading. –If a book sucks, stop reading it. The best readers actually quit a lot of books. Life is too short to read books you don’t enjoy reading. –The rule I like is ‘one hundred pages minus your age.’ Say you’re 30 years old—if a book hasn’t captivated you by page 70, stop reading it. So as you age, you have less time to endure crap. -Embrace serendipity. So many of my favorite books are just random things I grabbed at bookstores (this is why I say don’t sweat buying a book–just roll the dice). That’s what bookstores are for, what I’ve tried to build mine around. It’s a discovery engine better than any algorithm. -Don’t just build a library, build [...]",https://ryanholiday.net/these-38-reading-rules-changed-my-life/,01-general-reference / reading,,2023-09-10T20:30:44.597Z,https://10925d.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/August-RLE-scaled.jpg,,false

628138965,mi kama sona e toki pona or something,,"So I stumbled a few weeks ago on this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM] about the world's smallest conlang and I've been thinking about it ever since.

[https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/91c54129-9425-4695-bd68-6f65d83ae793/maxresdefault.jpeg] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM]

(You will probably have the idea more than fully by the ten minute mark.)

This fascinated me. I think languages are really interesting but I'm also really bad at them. I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no, now there's even more languages for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a language so minimal you can almost learn it by accident, suddenly my ears perk up.

Toki pona is really interesting, on a lot of different axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually Work This Time¹. It has NLP implications— it's a human language which feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write it². Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual object— nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a seemingly insoluble problem³ and does it with a sense of effortlessness and an implied ""LOL"" [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/747b4517-a3cf-438b-a6a0-07ad9e6883fd/Toki_pona.svg.png] at every step.

So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed around the idea of being as simple as it is possible for a language to be. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark, up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with only around twenty or thirty (I know this because this is roughly the size of my current tok vocabulary). The whole tok-en dictionary fits on seventeen printed pages [https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html]⁴. There are no conjugations or tenses to memorize. There are no parts of speech, generally: almost every single word can be used as almost any part of speech, drop a pronoun or a preposition⁵ in the right place and it becomes a verb, drop a verb in the right place and it becomes an adjective. There are almost no ambiguities in sentence structure; I've only found one significant one so far (using ""of"" [pi] twice in the same clause) and the community deals with this by just agreeing not to do that. There's in one sense quite a lot of ambiguity in the vocabulary but in another sense there's none; for example nena is listed in the dictionary as meaning hill, mountain, button, bump, nose, but the official ideology of Toki Pona is that this is not a word with five definitions, it is a word with exactly one definition, that being the concept encompassing all five of hills, mountains, buttons, bumps, and noses. Toki pona words are not ambiguous, they're just broad. I will now teach you enough toki pona to understand most sentences (assuming you consult the dictionary [https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html] as you go) in a paragraph shorter than this one:

Every sentence has an ""verb"" or action clause. Most sentences also have a subject clause, which goes before the verb separated by ""li"". Some sentences also have an ""object"" or target clause, which goes after the verb clause separated by ""e"". So ""[subject] li [verb] e [object]"". All three clauses are any number of words, the first word is the noun (or verb) and the rest are adjectives (or adverbs). If the first word in a sentence is mi or sina you can omit the li in that case only. There is no ""is"", a sentence like ""a flower is red"" is just ""[a plant] li [red]"" because there are no parts of speech and adjectives are verbs. Pronounce everything the way you would in English except ""j"" sounds like ""y"". If you see ""tawa"", ""lon"", ""tan"" or ""kepeken"" in adjective/adverb position that's a preposition, so treat whatever comes after it as a fourth clause. ""a"" and ""n"" are interjections and can go anywhere in a sentence. If you see ""o"", ""pi"", ""la"", ""taso, ""anu"" or ""en"", then you've found one of the few special words (particles) and you should probably either read the book [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS/] or watch the jan Misali instructional videos [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIjft6ja7DM70MkOMu56c4Grku7LXR61] on YouTube.

That's like… almost it!⁶ Watch one youtube video, or read a half page of grammar summary and keep the dictionary open on your phone, and you're basically ready to jump into conversations. (You'll need those last six particles to make nuanced sentences, but sentences do not have to be nuanced.) In my own case I watched the Langfocus video linked at the top and then lazily over the next week watched the jan Misali overview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLn6LC1RpAo] and two of their instructional videos then read a few chapters of the book, and was already able to construct a full paragraph and be understood by another person:

 o! mi sona e toki pona. mi lukin sona e toki mute... taso mi toki ike e toki ale. toki mute li jo e nimi mute. nimi mute li pona ala tawa mi. toki pona li pona e mi tan ni. toki pona li jo nimi lili. nimi lili li pona e me :)

(Translation: Hello! I am learning toki pona. I've tried to learn many languages… but I speak all of the[m] badly. Most languages have a lot of words. Lots of words is not good for me. Toki pona is good for me because of this. Toki pona has few words. Few words is good for me :)⁷)

So that's week one. By the end of week three (that'll be this past Sunday) I had hit three milestones:

 * I was able to make a joke in toki pona. Not a good one.
 * When the joke misfired, I was able to successfully toss off an entire complex paragraph rapidly without really thinking about it.
 * Probably a sign I Am Getting It more significant than anything else: I realized that talking on the Discord I was dropping toki pona words into my English sentences solely because the toki pona word seemed to me to communicate a concept I wanted to communicate more precisely than any particular English word.

(That last one actually kind of excited me when I realized, after the fact, that it had been happening for several days before I noticed it.)

All of the above happened on the toki pona Discord, which seems to be the largest and healthiest outpost of toki pona community online⁸ and, I assume therefore, the world. Here's my toki pona joke; you'll notice that I begin by preemptively apologizing for it, but by the end it becomes clear I was, at that moment anyway, apparently completely on the Discord's level:⁹

Footnotes

¹ Esperanto was meant to be an auxillary language simple enough the entire world could learn it as a second language. But it does not seem to me to be actually all that simple to learn (the verb tenses may be free of exceptions, but there are still like six of them) and it seems hard to convince myself to study it when I could put that effort toward a more widespread language. Toki Pona on the other hand is a language simple enough the entire world actually could learn it, had it reason to, and the buy-in cost in time is a lot lower. Meanwhile Toki Pona just seems to get certain international-accessibility things right, probably due to the advantage of having over a century of conlang practice largely inspired by Esperanto to draw from. The difference that's most interesting to me, but which I'm also least qualified to evaluate, is that the Toki Pona author had some basic familiarity with, and gave Toki Pona input from, east Asian languages. Both Toki Pona and Esperanto draw roots from a variety of languages but in Esperanto's case this winds up being mostly European languages, mostly Italian, whereas Toki Pona has Mandarin and Cantonese in its mix. Both languages were intended to have a minimal, universal phonology but Esperanto's is not very universal at all and has some consonant sounds that are going to be be totally unfamiliar unless you speak Polish or a language related to Polish. Toki Pona's phonology is actually minimal-- it has the letters in the sentence ""mi jan pi ko suwi lete"" and nothing else and the legal syllabary is basically hiragana without the combination syllables. Now, what I don't know is whether any of this actually helps speakers of Asian languages in practice or if it just makes surface choices that make it seem that way to a westerner like me. In practice if you find a toki pona speaker their native language is almost certainly English, so there doesn't seem to have been a great deal of testing as to how learnable it is to people from varied regions.

² I kept imagining toki pona as being like LLVM IR for human languages or something.

³ Designing an actually learnable, universal(?) international auxillary language.

⁴ By which I mean if you print the unofficial web version it's 17 pages long. But you can fit it in sixteen if you remove the web-specific introductory paragraph, the ""joke word"" kijetesantakalu, and the web footer with the ""trans rights now!"" banner in it.

⁵ There's an awkward nuance in the specific case of prepositions: if you drop a preposition into verb position it still winds up ""behaving like"" a preposition, it's just that the preposition describes an action. It's probably more accurate to say that the preposition phrase becomes a verb rather than the preposition itself. So for example ""mi tawa kalama"" means ""I went toward the sound"" [kamala is a noun and the object of the preposition] not ""I went loudly"" [as it would be if kamala were an adverb modifying tawa as a verb]. Going into detail on this because I don't want to mislead anyone but ""you can form a sentence using an unmodified preposition as a verb"" is such a fun fact I wa",https://cohost.org/mcc/post/59045-mi-kama-sona-e-toki,02-culture-and-the-arts / language,,2023-08-14T07:57:40.422Z,https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/388-438acade-125f-40d2-ae77-36f844443b4f-profile.jpg,,false

725717122,Microglial cell response to experimental periodontal disease - Journal of Neuroinflammation,,"Objectives Microglial activation is critical for modulating the neuroinflammatory process and the pathological progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia are involved in forming barriers around extracellular neuritic plaques and the phagocytosis of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that periodontal disease (PD) as a source of infection alters inflammatory activation and Aβ phagocytosis by the microglial cells. Methods Experimental PD was induced using ligatures in C57BL/6 mice for 1, 10, 20, and 30 days to assess the progression of PD. Animals without ligatures were used as controls. Maxillary bone loss and local periodontal tissue inflammation associated with the development of PD were confirmed by morphometric bone analysis and cytokine expression, respectively. The frequency and the total number of activated microglia (CD45+ CD11b+ MHCII+) in the brain were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mouse microglial cells (1 × 105) were incubated with heat-inactivated bacterial biofilm isolated from the ligatures retrieved from the teeth or with Klebsiella variicola, a relevant PD-associated bacteria in mice. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLR), and receptors for phagocytosis was measured by quantitative PCR. The phagocytic capacity of microglia to uptake β-amyloid was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Ligature placement caused progressive periodontal disease and bone resorption that was already significant on day 1 post-ligation (p",https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-023-02821-x,04-health-and-fitness / aging / alzheimers-disease-cognitive-deckine,,2024-01-30T06:37:36.272Z,https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12974-023-02821-x/MediaObjects/12974_2023_2821_Fig1_HTML.png,,false

782997520,World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour,,"Objectives To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.  Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations.  Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.  Conclusion These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.",https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1451&usg=AOvVaw1TH8OOMvR_Adhu7cn1wPg6,04-health-and-fitness / fitness-exercise / 0-lists,,2024-05-08T22:44:44.874Z,https://bjsm.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bjsports/54/24.cover-source.jpg,,false

537455807,"Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for improving depression, anxiety and distress: an overview of systematic reviews",,"Objective To synthesise the evidence on the effects of physical activity on symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress in adult populations.  Design Umbrella review.  Data sources Twelve electronic databases were searched for eligible studies published from inception to 1 January 2022.  Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials designed to increase physical activity in an adult population and that assessed depression, anxiety or psychological distress were eligible. Study selection was undertaken in duplicate by two independent reviewers.  Results Ninety-seven reviews (1039 trials and 128 119 participants) were included. Populations included healthy adults, people with mental health disorders and people with various chronic diseases. Most reviews (n=77) had a critically low A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews score. Physical activity had medium effects on depression (median effect size=−0.43, IQR=−0.66 to –0.27), anxiety (median effect size=−0.42, IQR=−0.66 to –0.26) and psychological distress (effect size=−0.60, 95% CI −0.78 to –0.42), compared with usual care across all populations. The largest benefits were seen in people with depression, HIV and kidney disease, in pregnant and postpartum women, and in healthy individuals. Higher intensity physical activity was associated with greater improvements in symptoms. Effectiveness of physical activity interventions diminished with longer duration interventions.  Conclusion and relevance Physical activity is highly beneficial for improving symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress across a wide range of adult populations, including the general population, people with diagnosed mental health disorders and people with chronic disease. Physical activity should be a mainstay approach in the management of depression, anxiety and psychological distress.

625350639,How to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes,,"How to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes                        How long does it take you to fall asleep at night? 10 minutes? An hour?  What if you could fall asleep in 2 minutes?  In the 1980s, the U.S. Army noticed that military pilots had been making simple mistakes caused by exhaustion — so they developed a simple technique to help them fall asleep quickly, day or night, in any conditions.   The result: pilots got more rest and felt more alert on the job, leading to fewer mistakes.   Fortunately, you don’t have to join the military to use the same technique in your bedroom. If you’re one of the many “civilians” who feel exhausted at work on a near-daily basis, you can use this technique to fight sleep deprivation and feel more productive at work.   In this article, you’ll learn how to use this military-grade sleeping method. And soon, you could be dozing off in as little as 2 minutes too.                     Should You Try Falling Asleep the Army Way?                   Many people struggle to fall asleep at night.  If you're average, it likely takes you about 10-20 minutes to get to sleep (1) — and if you struggle to fall asleep or deal with insomnia, it might take you over an hour to doze off. off.  And that’s a bigger problem than inconvenience alone.     If you have trouble falling asleep and you’re not waking up later to compensate, you’re likely not getting enough sleep. And sleep deprivation can lead to a variety of health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and death.             So what can you do if “sleep hacks” and counting sheep aren’t working for you?   Well... it may be time to stop using civilian methods and try falling asleep the army way.  The military technique you’re about to learn appeared in the 1981 book Relax and Win: Championship Performance. Since then, it has taught many people (both military and civilian) how to fall asleep as quickly as possible, in any environment, without any special equipment.  Before we dive in, be aware that it takes practice and patience to master this sleeping technique. But if you persevere, you’ll be rewarded: the army has reported that this works for 96% of people after 6 weeks (2). So be patient if you don’t experience results after one night.   Now that you’re briefed, let’s get right to it.   Ready, soldier?                   How to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes: Army Style          Step 1: Create the Right Environment for Sleep  First, set your alarm for the next morning. Then, silence your phone (no distractions!), turn off all lights except your bedside lamp, and sit on the edge of your bed with your legs hanging off the side.          Step 2: Start to Relax Before Sleeping   Now, it’s time to relax. Begin with your face muscles. Relax your forehead, eyes and tongue. (Yes, it’s okay to let your tongue hang loosely out of your mouth.)   Step 3: Just Breathe  For this step, try to only focus on breathing. In and out. No need to think about anything else.                 Step 4: Relax Your Lower Body   At this point, intentionally let your chest start to relax. Once you feel your chest muscles relaxing, start to relax your leg muscles, beginning with your upper legs before moving to your lower legs.      Step 5: Clear Your Thoughts and Drop Your Worries   Once your body is relaxed, spend about 10 seconds trying to release any thoughts from your mind.    Step 6: Visualization for Sleep   Since you might have trouble clearing your thoughts, try using visualization tactics.   For this, focus on one image and erase any other thoughts from your mind. A few methods mentioned in Relax and Win: Championship Performance includes:   Visualize yourself sitting in a canoe on a calm body of water. Look up and imagine a clear blue sky above you.  Picture yourself relaxing in a dark room in a black velvet hammock.  If these don’t work for you, try repeating the phrase “don’t think” in your head for 10 seconds.    Step 7: Go to Sleep   Now, turn off your bedside lamp, lie down and try to drift off to sleep. If this technique works, you should be snoozing within 2 minutes.                  If This Doesn’t Work For You…                 Don’t forget that this technique can take 6 weeks to become effective — so don’t be discouraged if it still feels difficult after a few attempts.   If you’re willing to commit to this sleep boot-camp for at least 6 weeks, you have a 96% chance of being able to consistently fall asleep in 2 minutes flat.   Isn’t that worth pursuing?                    Get to Sleep, Soldier.          If you’ve tried other sleep techniques with no success, don’t give up — this military-approved tactic could be the breakthrough you need.  With a few weeks of practice, you could be falling asleep in 2 minutes every single night.  Say goodbye to counting sheep and lying awake for hours. Say goodbye to researching sleep hacks on your lunch break, as you guzzle an XL, double-strength coffee.  With this tactic, you could fall asleep fast, wake up rested and feel prepared for a productive workday every day.  All it takes is a little bit of practice and patience. Read up on more details on how to fall asleep fast military style and put them to work.  Lastly, check out our article for our best-of-the-best collection of sleep tips and how to fall asleep fast. Good night and sleep tight!

180 days money back guarantee

You will not have nail fungus anymore. We can guarantee it.

Getting tired of constantly visiting the doctor, taking medications, and still, your toenail fungus just doesn't go away? Do you keep trying the latest healing methods, but fungus just hardly disappears, or it always comes back? Perhaps you don't know or don't believe in the effectiveness of antifungal laser devices and find them expensive to test? 

 With a 180-day money-back guarantee, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. To avoid this problem in the future, get Onychom now with our moneyback guarantee program.

813354140,Managing Oneself,,"Throughout history, people had little need to manage their careers—they were born into their stations in life or, in the recent past, they relied on their companies to chart their career paths. But times have drastically changed. Today we must all learn to manage ourselves. What does that mean? As Peter Drucker tells us in this seminal article first published in 1999, it means we have to learn to develop ourselves. We have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution to our organizations and communities. And we have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. It may seem obvious that people achieve results by doing what they are good at and by working in ways that fit their abilities. But, Drucker says, very few people actually know—let alone take advantage of—their fundamental strengths. He challenges each of us to ask ourselves: What are my strengths? How do I perform? What are my values? Where do I belong? What should my contribution be? Don’t try to change yourself, Drucker cautions. Instead, concentrate on improving the skills you have and accepting assignments that are tailored to your individual way of working. If you do that, you can transform yourself from an ordinary worker into an outstanding performer. Today’s successful careers are not planned out in advance.

414205884,importance of stupidity in scientific research,,"I recently saw an old friend for the first time in many years. We had been Ph.D. students at the same time, both studying science, although in different areas. She later dropped out of graduate school, went to Harvard Law School and is now a senior lawyer for a major environmental organization. At some point, the conversation turned to why she had left graduate school. To my utter astonishment, she said it was because it made her feel stupid. After a couple of years of feeling stupid every day, she was ready to do something else.I had thought of her as one of the brightest people I knew and her subsequent career supports that view. What she said bothered me. I kept thinking about it; sometime the next day, it hit me. Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Let me explain.For almost all of us, one of the reasons that we liked science in high school and college is that we were good at it. That can't be the only reason – fascination with understanding the physical world and an emotional need to discover new things has to enter into it too. But high-school and college science means taking courses, and doing well in courses means getting the right answers on tests. If you know those answers, you do well and get to feel smart.A Ph.D., in which you have to do a research project, is a whole different thing. For me, it was a daunting task. How could I possibly frame the questions that would lead to significant discoveries; design and interpret an experiment so that the conclusions were absolutely convincing; foresee difficulties and see ways around them, or, failing that, solve them when they occurred? My Ph.D. project was somewhat interdisciplinary and, for a while, whenever I ran into a problem, I pestered the faculty in my department who were experts in the various disciplines that I needed. I remember the day when Henry Taube (who won the Nobel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did.That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. Once I faced that fact, I solved the problem in a couple of days. (It wasn't really very hard; I just had to try a few things.) The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can.I'd like to suggest that our Ph.D. programs often do students a disservice in two ways. First, I don't think students are made to understand how hard it is to do research. And how very, very hard it is to do important research. It's a lot harder than taking even very demanding courses. What makes it difficult is that research is immersion in the unknown. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right question or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Admittedly, science is made harder by competition for grants and space in top journals. But apart from all of that, doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty.Second, we don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid – that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. I'm not talking about `relative stupidity', in which the other students in the class actually read the material, think about it and ace the exam, whereas you don't. I'm also not talking about bright people who might be working in areas that don't match their talents. Science involves confronting our `absolute stupidity'. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, `I don't know'. The point of the exam isn't to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it's the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student's weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student's knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project.Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time. No doubt, this can be difficult for students who are accustomed to getting the answers right. No doubt, reasonable levels of confidence and emotional resilience help, but I think scientific education might do more to ease what is a very big transition: from learning what other people once discovered to making your own discoveries. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.",https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research,05-history-and-events / trends-futures-fads / 2022 / 2022-07,mind,2022-07-06T07:07:01.124Z,https://cob.silverchair-cdn.com/cob/content_public/journal/jcs/issue/121/11/3/m_joces_121_11_cover.png?Expires=1719952567&Signature=PLWeoJ3SS1HrtdvlGGwsa3Ni7xRjsyH~BgzlwmMXemJKlQmc6We72u9iF93mnofBnq~1U~B2YB~u0G8Swn4qGe0ORibISShhrE2s8-wyfB29c08kfWbwSGtEKsKaJCcheygYnJ4-DtsIUlkvzSoaCrnkVfvo7N9Jb6t81NXGWuOJ1n4aaz7KBAoNx0rEtw5pf1EiVhswd5hcdgA3kQ0AI5fOGyyKHoDfB6c2dRcMp6HFFWZlH8wGV2E~qpWGjBNQaixVidXDNIHM3AMH3DTrBtLKcN-iDV6htq6U53XpR9THIcypnHk9RQTjnSuPodAzgw09bir1bkDdIUySkVk3GQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,,true

619647664,Frontier Women,,"This is a multi-title review. Titles include Comstock Women, Frontier Women, and Land of Many Hands - During the last year, one of the most popular subjects among western historians has been the often overlooked role played by women during America's westward expansion and settlement. These three books bear witness to that trend. Jeffrey's book is in the forefront, for it is a revised edition of a work that first appeared in 1979. Detailing the many diverse contributions made by women on the frontier and, in the process, destroying common stereotypes, the narrative reshapes and analyzes the 'civilizing' influence women had on the West. Revised material includes coverage of African American, Hispanic, Chinese, and Native American women. The author avoids demonizing the white frontier women by providing a deeper understanding of their roles and examining the experiences of ordinary women living ordinary lives. Written in a narrative style, it is more evenhanded than most gender-directed histories. A bibliography keyed to the chapters is provided. The lives of women in Nevada's Comstock mining area, with special emphasis on Virginia City, are related in a series of 12 essays compiled by James and Raymond. The Comstock experienced a boom from 1860 to 1880 with the rapid development of a concentration of the world's richest gold and silver mines. It was an area, contrary to common belief, populated with not only miners but also a large number of women. Many insights are presented in this book that have been previously overlooked. The idea of community in a boomtown environment is examined with a perceptive eye toward the contributions made by the women. Such diverse subjects as prostitution, dope, and Chinese women are used to provide a fresh perspective on their overall influence on the society. Gender archaeology is the subject of the final essay, indicating a new resource for investigating situations hampered by an absence of written records. Considerable use is made of illustrations, maps, and statistics in the form of graphs and tables. Sigerman uses an extensive amount of primary sources and documents to relate the diverse roles of women during and after the westward migration. Most interesting are the details of day-to-day living. Branding cows, cooking with buffalo chips, building adobe homes, and even handling wagons on precipitous mountain trails are some of the activities described. Courage, determination, and optimism were required of women on the frontier, who almost constantly faced threats to their survival and that of their families. Illustrated with many archival photographs, it is not as detailed and a bit more forced than the other books on this subject. It may, however, have more appeal to the general reader. A recommended list of further reading is provided. - Fred Egloff; 188p-",https://www.google.com/books/edition/Frontier_Women/veCFM5kr4z0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=San+Francisco+Ladies+Protection+and+Relief+Society+Eaton&pg=PA218&printsec=frontcover,06-human-activities / entitities / heritage / sflprf / eaton,,2023-08-02T06:03:57.930Z,https://books.google.ie/books/content?id=veCFM5kr4z0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73hAD_RpdQNGEak1sfL6jkBmXp14aJ7G4U5LRBiBLyXsrogfG6qF8IAsfPDwYifj-Ucks2HOhA6V-9u3syX8yG8EIW9289jI6T_PacBrhaoSW6kmOzAdG2Hy8CPITZa0u59tsx8,,false

In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations.

625866483,gwern on Substack,,"This is something I've long noticed. Generative music is highly feasible: spend some time listening to random OpenAI Jukebox samples https://jukebox.openai.com/ and note that this is generating raw audio from scratch, posted in *2020* using 2019 stuff, and not as scaled-up as GPT-3 was, and there's vastly more accessible audio data. You could also get fairly reasonable samples from non-raw-audio data sources with a few tricks (https://gwern.net/gpt-2-music) which sound even better if you put a tiny bit of effort into them (https://soundcloud.com/theshawwn/sets/ai-generated-videogame-music). So, where is it all?  It seems to be a combination of: (1) the copyright situation is much scarier. Music comes with *all sorts* of bizarre complex IP laws and rights that don't apply to text or images, and this is because of (and empowers) groups like the RIAA. Every commercial startup doing music-related generative work seems to keep things very quiet, as blackbox as possible, restricting to licensed datasets when possible, and definitely not releasing stuff. (2) lack of major hobbyist interest - people may like to listen to music, but a lot of it is parasocial, there's superstar winner-take-all effects, and people don't generally want to make their own music the way they do their own images & text - think about porn/hentai as a huge driver of image synthesis. There is no porn/hentai of music generative models. (3) relatively demanding compute compared to other modalities. Audio is just very, very bulky: a piece of music is made out of millions of individual datapoints (X frequencies times Y milliseconds), while you can make a recognizable image with just 64x64=4096 pixels. Jukebox wasn't as demanding as GPT-3-175b was... but it's still a lot more compute than most people want to spend. Even sampling Jukebox is pushing it: early use of the released Jukebox model deterred hobbyists when they realized it (a) didn't fit in their consumer GPUs and (b) would take like half a day to generate a full audio file. Yikes. It'd be a lot better today, of course, but is nowhere near the instant gratification of a GAN or near-instant of the OA API or heavily-optimized diffusion model.  I'd also note that images specifically has benefited from luck: you would be seeing way less generated images today, and you would be unimpressed by image progress, if Emad hadn't done what all of the giants refused to do and bankrolled a decent FLOSS image generation model. (You would be wrong to be unimpressed, because there were, and still are, many much better image generation models than the Stability ones, and trying to judge image generation SOTA by what an SD model can or cannot do is a serious mistake - but they are all locked up behind barriers so you can't use them.)",https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-284/comment/18354821,09-people-self / people-notable / gwern,,2023-08-11T17:27:08.869Z,"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a41d1b8-0e3c-44d4-b99a-8f52362678eb_1592x1800.png",,false

1338999313,Royal and Imperial Portraits. (@royalimperialportraits) • Instagram photos and videos,,"207 likes, 8 comments - royalimperialportraits on May 28, 2025: ""In this portrait photograph, Princess Vera Kudasheva is depicted in the costume she wore to the 1903 ball in the Winter Palace, the last great ball of Imperial Russia. The aristocracy wore lavish, expensive 17th century costumes, in accordance with the theme of the ancient Muscovite court. Gold, pearls, diamonds, and silks were used. Princess Vera dressed as a boyarina; that is a noblewoman.

Not much is known about her life; she was born into the Nirod family and married Prince Kudashev, with whom she had two children. Her father died in 1914. Vera died in 1920 in Paris, at just 45 years old, followed by her husband in 1933 and her mother in 1940. It is very likely that they fled Russia after the 1917 revolution. Paris was a very common location for Russian émigrés.

Stripped of their titles and properties, Russian nobles and aristocrats in exile had to adapt to different circumstances. They sold whatever they still owned and worked normal jobs such as taxi drivers. The dignity and acceptance of many aristocratic families, both those who remained in Russia or fled, is exemplary. Those who remained in Russia under the violent Communist regime were marked as ‘former people’ and, like the rest of the regime’s ‘enemies’, were subjected to severe persecution: arbitrary arrests, surveillance, imprisonment, torture, and ‘executions’ were common.

Those who fled, although spared from the regime’s brutality, still suffered hardship in exile. Both groups adapted to the best of their ability. Most families remained united, continued to marry and raise children, and lived modestly, often in rundown apartments, with the utmost humility.their members still married and had children.

A great book on this subject is that of Douglas Smith, called ‘Former People: The Final Days of the Russian Aristocracy’. It is beautifully written and extremely well researched."".",https://www.instagram.com/p/DKM6tXqOsLs/,09-people-self / theo-friends-family / koudashev,,2025-09-14T05:41:25.045Z,https://scontent-fra5-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.75761-15/501677345_17926779201065820_8187565455893115880_n.jpg?stp=c282.0.849.848a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=tqh_oBljJKIQ7kNvwHPQOPM&_nc_oc=AdmHHJpxwAEaR3XysOfhhmt6mSbK2gwNfMBj2jPi8Bs9ktP_7e_pY5ttMMxbW9WP4Zk&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-fra5-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=gwyY038KPBa01slNTFg0eQ&oh=00_AfYrW0KMZtWVK201Jci4D0YMLSvY9F_lOYJvLAxTmpchUg&oe=68CC0E19,,false

689944416,The Guggenheims,,"A portrait of a great American dynasty and its legacy in business, technology, the arts, and philanthropyMeyer Guggenheim, a Swiss immigrant, founded a great American business dynasty. At their peak in the early twentieth century, the Guggenheims were reckoned among America's wealthiest, and the richest Jewish family in the world after the Rothschilds. They belonged to Our Crowd, that tight social circle of New York Jewish plutocrats, but unlike the others -- primarily merchants and financiers -- they made their money by extracting and refining copper, silver, lead, tin, and gold.The secret of their success, the patriarch believed, was their unity, and in the early years Meyer's seven sons, under the leadership of Daniel, worked as one to expand their growing mining and smelting empire. Family solidarity eventually decayed (along with their Jewish faith), but even more damaging was the paucity of male heirs as Meyer and the original set of brothers passed from the scene.In the third generation, Harry Guggenheim, Daniel's son, took over leadership and made the family a force in aviation, publishing, and horse-racing. He desperately sought a successor but tragically failed and was forced to watch as the great Guggenheim business enterprise crumbled.Meanwhile, ""Guggenheim"" came to mean art more than industry. In the mid-twentieth century, led by Meyer's son Solomon and Solomon's niece Peggy, the Guggenheims became the agents of modernism in the visual arts. Peggy, in America during the war years, midwifed the school of abstract expressionism, which brought art leadership to New York City. Solomon's museum has been innovative in spreading the riches of Western art around the world.

Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions, it remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC.

An enigmatic figure, Socrates authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing figure in Athenian society. In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates,10-philosophy-and-thinking / philosophers / socrates,,2024-09-26T06:32:19.800Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Socrate_du_Louvre.jpg,,false

During the eighteenth century, when it began as historical-biblical criticism, it was based on two distinguishing characteristics: (1) the scientific concern to avoid dogma and bias by applying a neutral, non-sectarian, reason-based judgment to the study of the Bible, and (2) the belief that the reconstruction of the historical events behind the texts, as well as the history of how the texts themselves developed, would lead to a correct understanding of the Bible. This sets it apart from earlier, pre-critical methods; from the anti-critical methods of those who oppose criticism-based study; from the post-critical orientation of later scholarship; and from the multiple distinct schools of criticism into which it evolved in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_criticism,10-philosophy-and-thinking / philosophy-branches / logic / critical-thinking,,2024-05-06T07:41:04.548Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Title_page_of_the_%22Histoire_critique_du_vieux_testament%22_by_Richard_Simon.jpg,,false

The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic by using particular sources, techniques of research, and theoretical approaches to the interpretation of documentary sources. Scholars discuss historiography by topic — the historiography of the United Kingdom, of WWII, of the pre-Columbian Americas, of early Islam, and of China — and different approaches to the work and the genres of history, such as political history and social history. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the development of academic history produced a great corpus of historiographic literature.

The CRAAP test aims to make it easier for educators and students to determine if their sources can be trusted. By employing the test while evaluating sources, a researcher can reduce the likelihood of using unreliable information. The CRAAP test, developed by Sarah Blakeslee&#91;2&#93; and her team of librarians at California State University, Chico (CSU Chico),&#91;1&#93; is used mainly by higher education librarians at universities.

It is well documented that minority groups and marginalized communities suffer from poorer health outcomes.&#91;1&#93; This may be due to a multitude of stressors including prejudice, social alienation, institutional bias, political oppression, economic exclusion and racial discrimination.&#91;2&#93; The weathering hypothesis proposes that the cumulative burden of these stressors as individuals age is ""weathering,"" and the increased weathering experienced by minority groups compared to others can account for differences in health outcomes.&#91;3&#93; In recent years, the biological plausibility of the weathering hypothesis has been investigated in studies evaluating the physiological effects of social, environmental and political stressors among marginalized communities.&#91;4&#93; This has led to more widespread use of the weathering hypothesis as a framework for explaining health disparities on the basis of differential exposure to racially based stressors.&#91;5&#93; Researchers have also identified patterns connecting weathering to biological phenomena associated with stress and aging, such as allostatic load, epigenetics, telomere shortening, and accelerated brain aging.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering_hypothesis,12-society-and-social-sciences / bipoc,loneliness,2023-04-03T22:07:55.152Z,,,false

458416678,"Swiss Dwellings: A large dataset of apartment models including aggregated geolocation-based simulation results covering viewshed, natural light, traffic noise, centrality and geometric analysis",,"Introduction This dataset contains detailed data on 42,207 apartments (242,257 rooms) in 3,093 buildings including their geometries, room typology as well as their visual, acoustical, topological and daylight characteristics. Procurement The data is sourced from commercial clients of Archilyse AG specializing on the digitization and analysis of buildings. The existing building plans of clients are converted into a geo-referenced, semantically annotated representation and undergo a manual Q/A process to ensure accuracy of the data and to ensure a maximum 5%-deviation in the apartments' areas (validated with a median deviation of 1.2%). Geometries The dataset contains a file geometries.csv which contains the geometries of all areas, walls, railings, columns, windows, doors and features (sinks, bathtubs, etc.) of an apartment. In total the datasets contains the 2D geometry of ~1.2 million separators (walls, railings), ~550,000 openings (windows, doors), ca. 400,000 areas (rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc.) and ~240,000 features (sinks, toilets, bathtubs, etc.). Each row contains: entity_type: The entity type (area, separator, opening, feature) entity_subtype: The entity’s sub type (e.g. WALL) geometry: The element’s geometry as a WKT geometry. The geometry is given in the site’s local coordinate system. I.e. the position between elements of the same site are correct in respect to each other. The +y direction points northwards, the +x direction points eastwards. area_id: The ID of the area in which the element is spatially contained (for features) unit_id: The ID of the unit in which the element is spatially contained (for features, areas) apartment_id: The ID of the apartment (for features, areas) floor_id: The ID of the floor building_id: The ID of the building site_id: The ID of the site An example: column   entity_type area entity_subtype ROOM geometry POLYGON ((-2.10406 4.02039… site_id 127 building_id 164 floor_id 12864 apartment_id d4438f2129b30290845ce7eef98a5ba7 unit_id 76643 area_id 684674 Simulations Beside the geometrical model, we also provide simulation data on the visual, acoustic, solar, layout and connectivity-related characteristics of the apartments. The file simulations.csv contains the simulation data aggregated on a per-area basis. Each row contains the identifier columns area_id, unit_id, apartment_id, floor_id, building_id, site_id as defined above as well as 367 simulation columns. Each simulation column is formatted as: simulation_category_simulation_dimensions_aggregation_function For instance. the column view_buildings_median describes the amount of building surface that can be seen from any point in a given room. The aggregation methods vary per simulation category and are described in detail below. Layout The layout features represent simple features based on the geometry and composition of a room, the dataset provides the following information in an unaggregated form. Area Basics / Geometry dimension description layout_area_type The area’s area type layout_net_area The area’s share of the apartment’s net area (e.g. 0 for a balcony) layout_area The area’s actual area layout_perimeter The area’s perimeter layout_compactness The area’s compactness (the Polsby–Popper score) layout_room_count The area’s share to the apartment’s room count layout_is_navigable True if the area is navigable by a wheelchair Area Features dimension description layout_has_sink True if the area has a sink layout_has_shower True if the area has a shower layout_has_bathtub True if the area has a bathtub layout_has_toilet True if the area has a toilet layout_has_stairs True if the area has stairs layout_has_entrance_door True if the area is directly leading to an exit of the apartment Area Windows / Doors dimension description layout_number_of_doors The number of doors directly leading to the area layout_number_of_windows The number of windows of the area layout_door_perimeter The sum of all door lengths directly leading to the area layout_window_perimeter The sum of all window lengths of the area Area Walls / Railings dimension description layout_open_perimeter The sum of all of the areas boundaries that are neither walls nor railings layout_railing_perimeter The sum of all of the areas boundaries that are railings layout_mean_walllengths The mean length of the area’s sides layout_std_walllengths The standard deviation of the lengths of the area’s sides Area Adjecency dimension description layout_connects_to_bathroom True if the area connects to a bathroom layout_connects_to_private_outdoor True if the area connects to an outside area that is private to the apartment View The views from an object help to understand the impact of the surroundings on the object. The view simulation calculates the visible amount of buildings, greenery, water etc. on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object. The values are expressed in steradians (sr) and represent the amount a certain object category occupies in the spherical field of view. Each of the following dimension is provided using the room-wise aggregations min, max, mean, std, median, p20 and p80. For instance, the column view_greenery_p20 describes the amount of greenery that can be seen from at least 20% of the positions in the area. dimension description view_buildings The amount of visible buildings view_greenery The amount of visible greenery view_ground The amount of visible ground view_isovist The amount of visible isovist view_mountains_class_2 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 2 view_mountains_class_3 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 3 view_mountains_class_4 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 4 view_mountains_class_5 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 5 view_mountains_class_6 The amount of visible mountains of UN mountain class 6 view_railway_tracks The amount of visible railway_tracks view_site The amount of visible site view_sky The amount of visible sky view_tertiary_streets The amount of visible tertiary_streets view_secondary_streets The amount of visible secondary_streets view_primary_streets The amount of visible primary_streets view_pedestrians The amount of visible pedestrians view_highways The amount of visible highways view_water The amount of visible water Sun Sun simulations help to understand the impact of the solar radiation on the object. The outcome of the sun simulations helps to identify surfaces that have great solar potential. Sun simulations are defined by the amount of sun radiation on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object. The sun simulation not only includes direct sun but also considers scattered light. The sun simulation values are given in Kilolux (klx). Simulations are performed for the days of summer solstice, winter solstice and vernal equinox.

The acoustic simulation calculates the noise intensity on each individual hexagon from the analyzed object considering traffic and train noise datasets. Adjacent buildings are considered as noise blocking elements. The values are expressed in dBA (decibels). Window Noise The noise per window of a given area is aggregated via min and max. For instance, window_noise_train_day_max represents the maximum amount of noise received on any window of the area. dimension description window_noise_traffic_day The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from daytime car traffic window_noise_traffic_night The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from night-time car traffic window_noise_train_day The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from daytime train traffic window_noise_train_night The amount of noise received on the area’s windows from night-time train traffic Area-Wise Noise The area-wise noise describes the amount of noise received from a noise source aggregated over the whole area in an unaggregated form. For instance, noise_traffic_night describes the dBA of noise received in the area from car traffic at night when propagating noise from all windows. dimension description noise_traffic_day The amount of noise received in the area from daytime car traffic noise_traffic_night The amount of noise received in the area from night-time car traffic noise_train_day The amount of noise received in the area from daytime train traffic noise_train_night The amount of noise received in the area from night-time train traffic Connectivity Centrality simulations help to analyze a floor plan, whether it’s a shopping mall and you want to identify prominent areas",https://zenodo.org/record/7070952#.Y0pYznbMLb0,13-technology-applied-sciences / architecture,,2022-10-15T07:05:32.495Z,,,false

764004253,Replit — Building LLMs for Code Repair,,"Introduction

At Replit, we are rethinking the developer experience with AI as a first-class citizen of the development environment. Towards this vision, we are tightly integrating AI tools with our IDE. Currently, LLMs specialized for programming are trained with a mixture of source code and relevant natural language, such as Github issues and StackExchange posts. These models are not trained to interact directly with the development environment, and therefore have limited ability to understand events or use tools within Replit. We believe that by training models that are native to Replit, we can create more powerful AI tools for developers.

A simple example of a Replit-native model takes a session event as input and returns a well-defined response. We set out to identify a scenario where we could develop such a model which could also become a useful tool for our current developers, and settled on code repair. Developers spend a significant fraction of their time fixing bugs in software. In 2018, when Microsoft released “A Common Protocol for Languages”, Replit began supporting the Language Server Protocol. Since then, the LSP has helped millions using Replit to find errors in their code. This puts LSP diagnostics among our most common events, with hundreds of millions per day. However, while the LSP identifies errors, it is only able to provide fixes in limited cases. In fact, only 10% of LSP diagnostic messages in Python projects on Replit have associated fixes. Given the abundance of training data, repairing code errors using LSP diagnostics is therefore the ideal setting to build our first Replit-native AI model.

1325034766,Ruben Hassid (@ruben),,"Most people guess prompting.

But these prompts fix 80% of your needs:

To access my blog on 7 Sins of Prompting, go to: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W

1. Start with “Let’s think about this differently”

↳ It stops giving you generic answers.

↳ You get creative, out-of-the-box ideas.

2. Use “What am I not seeing here?”

↳ This finds blind spots and hidden assumptions.

↳ You get a wider, smarter view of your problem.

3. Say “Break this down for me”

↳ Even for simple things, this works.

↳ AI explains the steps, the science, and the why.

4. Ask “What would you do in my shoes?”

↳ AI stops being neutral and gives real opinions.

↳ You get advice that’s specific and actionable.

5. Use “Here’s what I’m really asking”

↳ Add this after your main question.

↳ You get answers that fit your true needs.

6. End with “What else should I know?”

↳ This is the secret weapon.

↳ You get a complete answer, not just a quick fix.",https://substack.com/@ruben/note/c-152151370?r=1em2u,13-technology-applied-sciences / computing-ai / ai-chat / ai-prompt,,2025-09-04T23:27:19.943Z,https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55f475a4-4e8d-4fdf-b888-64694927e0d8_800x1000.jpeg,,false

646598312,The Illustrated Stable Diffusion,,"Translations: Chinese, Vietnamese.   (V2 Nov 2022: Updated images for more precise description of forward diffusion. A few more images in this version)  AI image generation is the most recent AI capability blowing people’s minds (mine included). The ability to create striking visuals from text descriptions has a magical quality to it and points clearly to a shift in how humans create art. The release of Stable Diffusion is a clear milestone in this development because it made a high-performance model available to the masses (performance in terms of image quality, as well as speed and relatively low resource/memory requirements).    After experimenting with AI image generation, you may start to wonder how it works.  This is a gentle introduction to how Stable Diffusion works.            Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a number of different ways. Let’s focus at first on image generation from text only (text2img). The image above shows an example text input and the resulting generated image (The actual complete prompt is here). Aside from text to image, another main way of using it is by making it alter images (so inputs are text + image).",https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/&usg=AOvVaw0H5hjXHfv-GJKufGKEPvOk,13-technology-applied-sciences / computing-ai / ai-image,,2023-09-14T05:35:15.522Z,,,false

802605458,Alberto Romero on Substack,,"The 7 deadly sins of AI companies:

Pride: “No one else but us knows how to bring prosperity and abundance to this world. God appointed us to do his bidding, which is building a new god. We're the chosen ones.”

Greed: “To do it it's not enough being non-profit or prioritizing people. We need to tell you sci-fi stories about superintelligence while we increase our revenue with these things that are polluting the commons.”

Lust: “We monetized sex with PornHub; we monetized dating with Tinder; we’ll now monetize love and loneliness with Girlfriends, Inc. Tell her all your darkest desires.”

Envy: “Why can social media companies have all this data about users but we can’t? Let us remain as an anomalously unregulated space so we can collect all those juicy convos.”

Gluttony: “We need to feed the entire public internet—tons and tons of data created by you—into these giant models to make AI almost capable of making an excel spreadsheet.”

Wrath: “If you try to stop us from making this happen we will lobby the entire world, buy press companies, appoint national security experts, and establish a discourse that will compel your boss to replace you.”

Sloth: “A new efficient algorithm that wastes less electricity and water? No, not really urgent to build that. It’s better to lay down while these giant computers use up as many resources as they need to self-fulfill the prophecy of scale: more is always better.”",https://substack.com/@thealgorithmicbridge/note/c-59148499,13-technology-applied-sciences / computing-ai / ai-media / ai-threat,loneliness,2024-06-17T17:53:43.483Z,"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_680,h_680,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fnote%2Fc-59148499%2FpreviewSmall.jpg",,false

629035790,Understanding In-Context Learning via Supportive Pretraining Data,,"In-context learning (ICL) improves language models' performance on a variety
of NLP tasks by simply demonstrating a handful of examples at inference time.
It is not well understood why ICL ability emerges, as the model has never been
specifically trained on such demonstrations. Unlike prior work that explores
implicit mechanisms behind ICL, we study ICL via investigating the pretraining
data. Specifically, we first adapt an iterative, gradient-based approach to
find a small subset of pretraining data that supports ICL. We observe that a
continued pretraining on this small subset significantly improves the model's
ICL ability, by up to 18%. We then compare the supportive subset constrastively
with random subsets of pretraining data and discover: (1) The supportive
pretraining data to ICL do not have a higher domain relevance to downstream
tasks. (2) The supportive pretraining data have a higher mass of rarely
occurring, long-tail tokens. (3) The supportive pretraining data are
challenging examples where the information gain from long-range context is
below average, indicating learning to incorporate difficult long-range context
encourages ICL. Our work takes a first step towards understanding ICL via
analyzing instance-level pretraining data. Our insights have a potential to
enhance the ICL ability of language models by actively guiding the construction
of pretraining data in the future.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15091,13-technology-applied-sciences / computing-ai / ai-topics / ai-in-context-learning,"ai, icl, 13",2023-08-15T17:23:09.698Z,https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png,,false

LLMs show human-level performance in many professional and academic fields, showing a great understanding of language rules and patterns. However, they often struggle with reasoning reliably and flexibly. This problem likely comes from the way transformers, the underlying architecture, work. They solve problems step-by-step, predicting the next word in a sequence, which limits their ability to backtrack and fix errors. Moreover, LLMs are trained statistically, which creates challenges in handling problems outside their training distribution.
