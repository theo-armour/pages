## Introduction

Anyway, As  I was adding topics, I decoded I needed a way of cataloging or categorizing the topics. I tried to apply my "Perceive Act Judge" ideas and this was a fail. There seemed to be no reason as to why one of these categories was better or more focussed on an activity than the others. Maslow's Hierarchy also was of little help. So then I started rummaging through my bookmarks and hit a gold mine - that hit the goal line.


[12 Life Goal Categories]( https://www.glidedesign.com/12-life-goal-categories/)

Here was a set of nouns I could relate to. Not verbs like "Perceive Act Judge" which are aspects of behaving and not adjectives such as better or worse and no project management adverbs such as before or after.

I googled "Life Goal Categories" and dozens of results arrived.  After looking at a number of them, it turns out there are many similarities. They mostly all contain something like the following list

* Career goals
* Health goals
* Family goals
* Money/financial goals
* Spiritual goals
* Personal goals

Then me being a crafty one, I moved them about into this

* Career goals
* Money/financial goals
* Health goals
* Personal goals
* Family goals
* Spiritual goals

Which then morphed into

* Doing ~ Act ~ Career goals - Money/finance goals
* Knowing ~ Perceive ~ Health goals - Personal goals
* Being ~ Judge ~ Family goals - Spiritual goals

Yay! We have a way of categorizing the what in the "who, what, when, where & why" and maybe even a bit of "how" or "When"
