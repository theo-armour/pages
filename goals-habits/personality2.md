# Personality Types & Psychology

> Everyone has a Creative Type. What’s yours?

The Creative Types test is an exploration of the many faces of the creative personality. Based in psychology research, the test assesses your basic habits and tendencies—how you think, how you act, how you see the world—to help you better understand who you are as a creative. Answer these 15 questions and you’ll gain a deeper understanding of your motivations, plus insight into how to maximize your natural gifts and face your challenges.

These personality types aren’t black-and-white labels. Think of them more as signposts pointing you toward your full creative potential. While there’s probably one core type that best describes you, you may change types at different points in your life and career, or even at different stages of the creative process. As a creative, you have a little bit of all eight Types inside you.

## Notes: Give yourself an unfair advantage

### Attitude

* Extravert: the outer world of people, places and things
* Introvert: our inner world of ideas, concepts and images

### Perceiving

* Senser: using our 5 senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste) To give us the present facts about the world. we know, because we can see it here it, touch it etc
* iNtuitive: a "sixth sense" that uses instant mental interconnections to show us the meanings of things. we know, we don't know how we know it; it's a hunch we can rely on

### Judging

* Thinking: Deciding objectively, using the laws of logic as the criteria. A rational process.
* Feeling: Starting subjectively, using personal values as the criteria. also a rational process, but the criteria are different

### Life styles

* Perceiving: Getting more and more information, delaying decisions
* Judging: Deciding as quickly as possible, shutting off information flow as soon as it's feasible to decide and move on
