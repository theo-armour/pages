## Myers Briggs

### Extraversion/Introversion

* The extraverted types learn best by talking and interacting with others. By interacting with the physical world, extraverts can process and make sense of new information.
* The introverted types prefer quiet reflection and privacy. Information processing occurs for introverts as they explore ideas and concepts internally.

### Sensing/Intuition

* Sensing types are good at concrete and tangible things.
* Intuitive types are good at abstract things and ideas.
* Sensing types might enjoy a learning environment in which the material is presented in a detailed and sequential manner.
* Sensing types often attend to what is occurring in the present and can move to the abstract after they have established a concrete experience.
* Intuitive types might prefer a learning atmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on meaning and associations.
* Insight is valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for intuitive types.

## Thinking/Feeling

The third continuum reflects a person's decision preferences.

* Thinking types desire objective truth and logical principles and are natural at deductive reasoning.
* Feeling types place an emphasis on issues and causes that can be personalized while they consider other people's motives.

## Judging/Perceiving

The fourth continuum reflects how a person regards complexity.

* Judging types tend to have a structured way or theory to approach the world.
* Perceiving types tend to be unstructured and keep options open.
* Judging types will always try to make accommodation between new information and their structured world, which might only be changed with discretion.
* Perceiving types will be more willing to change without having a prior structured world.
