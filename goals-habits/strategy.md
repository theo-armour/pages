## Strategies ~ How will you get there?

Strategy, narrowly defined, means "the art of the general" - a combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there. 

A strategy is sometimes called a roadmap - which is the path chosen to plow towards the end vision. 

The most important part of implementing the strategy is ensuring the company is going in the right direction - defined as towards the end vision.

* How we will achieve our vision?
* How are we going to progress?


### Strategic Planning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning

From Aspirational to Achievable to Specific & Tangible


## Targets

What will you get done?

* Plans, Goals, Sequencing
* Goals & Objectives


## Indicators

When will you get there?

* How you measure and gauge our degrees of success?
* What are the metrics and where are they defined?
* Actions, Owners, Time-frames, Resources, Outcomes

### What are indicators?

An indicator is a specific, observable and measurable characteristic that can be used to show changes or progress a programme is making toward achieving a specific outcome.

There should be at least one indicator for each outcome. The indicator should be focused, clear and specific. The change measured by the indicator should represent progress that the programme hopes to make.

An indicator should be defined in precise, unambiguous terms that describe clearly and exactly what is being measured. Where practical, the indicator should give a relatively good idea of the data required and
the population among whom the indicator is measured.

Indicators do not specify a particular level of achievement -- the words “improved”, “increased”, or “decreased” do not belong in an indicator.


### Characteristics of good indicators

Valid: accurate measure of a behavior, practice, task that is the expected output or outcome of the intervention

Reliable: consistently measurable over time, in the same way by different observers

Precise: operationally defined in clear terms

Measurable: quantifiable using available tools and methods

Timely: provides a measurement at time intervals relevant and appropriate in terms of programme goals and activities

Programmatically important: linked to the programme or to achieving the programme objectives (Gage and Dunn, 2009)


### Challenges and considerations when selecting indicators

In an ideal world, indicators judged to be the highest quality and most useful would be the ones selected and used to monitor and evaluate programme activities.

However, in the real world many other factors may intervene. Links to programme activities, as outlined in monitoring and evaluation frameworks are important, as are the needs of the programme for decision-making.

Many indicators in common use are not well-defined in clear terms, or at least include terminology that could be improved to add greater precision. For instance, “knowledge of dating violence”, “attitude towards violence against women”, “support-seeking behavior” of victims of violence, or “quality of services” can all mean and imply different things in different circumstances.

The more defined an indicator, the less room there will be for later confusion or complications. For example, “percentage of women accessing health services at X facility from TIME A to TIME B who state that they received appropriate care and assistance” or “percentage of men who state that it is not acceptable to hit, slap, punch their wives with hands or other objects under any circumstances.”

Ideal indicators may not be practical; the feasibility of using certain indicators can be constrained by the availability of data and financial and human resources. The requirements and needs of donors, the government, organization headquarters and others may need to be given priority.


### Some examples of these considerations are

Availability of data: Some data may be considered ‘privileged’ information by agencies, projects, or government officials.

Data may be available only on aggregated levels or already calculated into indicators that may not be the ideal indicators for your programme or activities.

Resources: Ideal indicators might require collecting data to calculate an unknown denominator, or national data to compare with project area data, or tracking lifetime statistics for an affected and/or control population, etc.

The cost of collecting appropriate data for ideal indicators is prohibitive.

Human resources and technical skills may be a constraint as well.

Programmatic and external requirements: Indicators may be imposed from above by those not trained in monitoring and evaluation techniques.

Reporting schedules may not be synchronized (e.g. fiscal vs. reporting year).

Different stakeholders’ priorities may diverge.

Standardized indicators should be used if available.

In general, programmes should stay away from indicators that activities cannot affect, that are too vague, that do not currently exist and cannot realistically be collected, or that do not accurately represent the desired outcome. (Gage and Dunn, 2009)

When quantitative indicators of success cannot be identified, qualitative methods offer a valuable alternative. When it is difficult or not possible to measure “benefits” or “risks” in simple, quantitative terms, it is almost always possible to gather qualitative data, such as information on the perspectives of health care providers and women who come for services. In many cases, qualitative indicators provide more relevant information with respect to the success and effectiveness of the intervention. (Bott, Guedes and Claramunt, 2004) See the qualitative approaches section.

Information on the perspectives of women and girls (rights-holders) and service providers (governmental duty-bearers or NGOs) is essential. Evaluation efforts and indicators should include the perspectives of both clients and providers. Information from women accessing or attempting to access services is critical for assessing the effectiveness of an intervention.

Select a set of indicators that pertain to the identified objectives for the programme. If the intervention focuses on training providers, select indicators related for example to providers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices, ability to provide care, ability to make referrals, or others depending on the specific objective.


### How many indicators are enough?

Some guidelines to follow when selecting indicators:
At least one or two indicators per result (ideally, from different sources)
At least one indicator for every core activity (e.g. training, airing of TV spot)
No more than 8-10 indicators per area of significant programme focus
Use a mix of data collection strategies and sources


### Process versus result/impact indicators

It is important to remember the difference between process and results indicators

Process Indicators are used to monitor the number and types of activities carried out.  Examples include:

* The number and types of services provided
* The number of people trained
* The number and type of materials produced and disseminated
* The number and percentage of female clients screened

Results Indicators are used to evaluate whether or not the activity achieved the intended objectives or results. Examples include:

Selected indicators of knowledge, attitudes and practices as measured by a survey
The perceptions of survivors about the quality and benefits of services provided by an organization or institution as measured by individual interviews (Bott, Guedes and Claramunt, 2004)

Results indicators can be developed at the output, outcome and impact levels. (Bott, Guedes and Claramunt, 2004)

Output indicators illustrate the change related directly to the activities undertaken within the programme (e.g. percentage of traditional leaders in community x who completed the training on international human rights standards related to violence against women and girls whose knowledge improved.)

Outcome indicators relate to change that is demonstrated as a result of the programme interventions in the medium-to-longer term (e.g. the number of decisions in the informal justice system of community x related to violence against women that reflect a human rights-based approach.)

Impact indicators measure the long-term affect of programme interventions (e.g. the prevalence of violence against women and girls in community x.)

An important issue that needs to be resolved in order to monitor project progress is how to define success.  Commonly, organizations are able to track how many events they have held, and how many people have participated (outputs), but not how people have changed their attitudes or behaviors as a result (outcomes), especially over time.

The main indicator of impact should be a reduction in the prevalence and incidence of violence, but that takes years to achieve and to measure. So more indicators are needed to gauge whether programmes are moving in the right direction.

Monitoring and evaluation frameworks and plans should incorporate both process and results indicators.
