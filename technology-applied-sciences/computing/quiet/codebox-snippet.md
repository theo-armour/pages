## Embedding ~ https://codesandbox.io/docs/embedding

CodeSandbox has a separate application for the embed. This application is specifically built to be as small as possible. If you replace s in the URL of a sandbox to embed you have the embed version of the sandbox.

An embed enables you to include a sandbox in your documentation, blog post, or website using an iframe, or anywhere with Embedly support, like Medium, Reddit, Trello, and Notion. You can show just the code, the preview, or both at the same time.
