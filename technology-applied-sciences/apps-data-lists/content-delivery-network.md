Using GH pages is proably just as fast and timely for my JavaScript files

## [unpkg]( https://unpkg.com/#/ )

unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm. Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL like:

* https://unpkg.com/three/
* https://unpkg.com/three/build/three.js
* https://unpkg.com/three@0.130/build/three.js
* https://unpkg.com/three@0.97.0/build/three.js
* https://unpkg.com/three@0.97.0/build/three.min.js
* https://unpkg.com/three@0.71.0/build/three.min.js << not
* https://unpkg.com/three@0.91.0/build/three.min.js << ok
