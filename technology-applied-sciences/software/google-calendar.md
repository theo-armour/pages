## Embedding

## Tips

* Importing is quite easy
* Always add headers
  * "Start Date","Start Time","Location","Subject"
  * "Start date","Subject","All Day Event","Description"
* Cannot import recurring events. must add each year. This is probably a good thing.
* If only a start time is entered, an end time of one hour later is assumed
