  _ Conner has learned to win by turning conventional wisdom upside down.
  _ 'Sell, design, build' is the company's business formula -- in that order. \* To marry itself to customers and justify R&D expense, Conner won't engineer a new product unless a major buyer has already spoken for it.

## Science Of Persuasion

1. Reciprocity.
   - Obligation to give when you receive.
   - Be the first to give.
   - Personalized and unexpected.
   - When you ask, likely to say "yes"
2. Scarcity.
   - If it's scarce, we want it more.
   - People want more of those things there are less of
   - Use this by highlighting the Benefits, Uniqueness and Possible Loss.
3. Authority.
   - We are more likely to comply with a request if it is coming from a perceived authority/expert.
   - People will follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts
4. Consistency.
   - We want to be consistent with our past commitments, even if the initial commitment is much smaller.
   - Looking for commitments that can be made
5. Liking.
   - We like people who are similar, who give us compliments and who co-operate with us.
   - People who are similar to us
   - People who pay us compliments
   - People who cooperate with us
6. Consensus
   - If others (especially similar others) are doing it, then we are more likely to do it ourselves.
   - People will look to the actions of others to determine their own
