Hi Tony

I am enjoying surfing through your Wikipedia and personal life efforts. It's nice to read things by a person who just likes to write.

***

I have been drafting a Chicago biography-related article. There are conflict of interest issues since I revere and am related to the subject of the article.

Here is a link to the draft:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theoa/George_Armour

Here is a link to my working biography:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theoa/bibliography_for_George_Armour_article

Generally there probably enoghh references and images. The text still needs more work.

Would you kindly recommend and/or introduce me to a Chicago Project Wikipedian who might be interested in publishing this draft as a full article in mainspace?

Alternatively, if there an already established procedure in the Chicago Project, then can you point me in the best direction to progress the draft to the next stage.



### Done
