### ✅ How to Use

* **Row = Signal** → Trend to track.
* **Column = Gap** → Dimension to check.
* **Cell reminder** → What to look for in that intersection.
* **Tick boxes** → Mark coverage as you read; empty = blind spot.

This version is **self-contained** : each cell reminds you what to check, so you don’t need to flip back to notes. It’s designed to fit neatly on one page for printing or digital annotation.

Would you like me to also **condense this into a minimalist “dashboard grid”** (just signals × gaps with blank boxes, no text inside) so you can fill in your own notes instead of using my reminders?
