>Dawn of Everything - A New History of Humanity

* https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357/thedawnofeverything

>A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.
>
>For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.
>
>Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.
>
>The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

> Graeber and Wengrow offer a history of the past 30,000 years that is not only wildly different from anything we’re used to, but also far more interesting: textured, surprising, paradoxical, inspiring.

>The authors introduce us to sumptuous Ice Age burials (the beadwork at one site alone is thought to have required 10,000 hours of work), as well as to monumental architectural sites like Göbekli Tepe, in modern Turkey, which dates from about 9000 B.C. (at least 6,000 years before Stonehenge) and features intricate carvings of wild beasts.

## Me

The book is written as a college course - the usual twelve or so chapters with thoughts of previous chapters refrained as reminders throughout

There are many quotable sequences - but they are unusually long -two or more sentences

Graeber offers no solutions, just plenty of hope

We are locked in by our vocabulary

Hobbes: best: modest control - but destiny

Rousseau: minor tinkering ~ but some free will

Rousseau & Hobbes: The path of least resistance leads the the hierarchical bureaucratic charismatic state
Gaeber: nope, that'a a myth

Pinker: more of the same as R & H ~ cities bring safety

## Bullets

History is not a progression or evolution ~ History is
Current history
* Simply isn't true
* Has dire political implications
* Makes the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful
foraging and agriculture do not follow they coexist
hunter-gathers: heroic ~ farmers peaceful
Agriculture was not a revolution
All cultures have critique ~ no stupidity
Inequality is not inevitable ~ egalitarian hard to define
Hierarchies are not required
Seasonality and theater are strong elements of life
Development of Science and Math may may have been by women

Reviewer
* Sapient Paradox brushed aside
* Early societies more like high school gossip groups




## Definitions

Freedoms
* To move
* To disobey
* To rearrange social ties

Long Distance Interaction ~ p 23
* Dreams or vision Quests
* Traveling healers and entertainers
* Women's gambling



## Chapter 1 ~ page 1 ~ 1%This is not a book about the origins of inequality.

This is not a book about the origins of inequality

This is the right time for metamorphosis, of fundamental principles and symbols. Jung

Most of history is lost. Little consequence for most people..

The world seems to be in a mess; was it always like this?

Theological question: Are we innately good or are we innately evil

Actually nonsensical question. We don't ask animals if they are good.

Original sin. We were godlike, but now are in a fallen state

First: Jean-Jacques Rousseau ~ _Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality among Mankind_ 1754

Child-like innocence until agricultural revolution
Then civilization, state
Then patriarchy, armies, executions, bureaucrats

Only other offer, even worse

Thomas Hobbes ~ _Leviathan_ ~ 1651

Primitive life: nasty, short and brutish, repression of basic instincts.

Always: Alpha male, hierarchy and domination come., cynical self interest
Progress: courts, bureaucracy, police

Human society is founded on collective repression - especially when large numbers

history is evolutionary: wrong!

We don't like these choices!

Graeber: Most accounts of history

* Simply isn't true
* Has dire political implications
* Makes the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful

Hunter gatherers : bold social experiments.

Agriculture relatively free of ranks and hierarchies.

p 4
* Bold social experiments
* Multitude of political forms
* Absence of private property
* Free of ranks and hierarchies

question of history: not equal access to resources but equal capacity to contribute to decisions how to live together

Need Radical shift

Forget: Social evolution, stages of development

Revisit: indigenous critique ~ take seriously social thought that is non-European

### Why both the Hobbesian and Rousseauian versions of human history have dire political implications

Reussaeau: Humankind descended To send it into inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence.

Modern thinking: even if it's unjust, a bit of tinkering might make it work.

Palatable to the rich.But to actual reformers, no solution is evident.

Diamond: Only primordial are egalitarian

Hierarchy is inevitable

Small groups not necessarily egalitarian; large groups must have rulers or bureaucracies.

Cubing in a gallatin society might be possible, but only if lived in a tiny band of foragers.

The ultimate question of human history is not equal access to material resources.But our.Equal capacity to contribute to decisions about how to live together.

We are projects of collective self creation.We must treat people from the beginning as a managership, intelligent, playful creatures who deserve to be understood as such?

### Some brief examples of why received understandings of the broad sweep of human history are mostly wrong.Or the eternal return of Jean Jacques Rousseau.

Fukuyama : Haunting bands very egalitarian.
Pinker: pre-state people were violent

For both, the invention of Agriculture puts an end to equality

Graeber: There is no reason to believe that small groups were egalitarian, or that large ones must necessarily have kings presidents or even bureaucracies.

p14
Early humans nurturing and caring

Early life more complex than modern theorist would guess

p17
Democracy not liked before 19th C

Has Western civilization made life better?

Impoverished history ~ simplification ~ reductionism ~ dulled down

p18
People return to tribal life

### How to conventional narrative of human history is not only wrong, but quite needlessly dull

Standard history reduces people to cardboard stereotypes.

When we impoverished history, we impoverished our sense of possibility.

Goods travel without market economy

### In which we show how critiques of eurcentrism can backfire and end up turning aboriginal thinkers into soft puppets.

Dijon: essay competition on the question: what is the origin of inequality among men, And is it authorized by natural law?

Assumed inequality did have an origin and that there was a time when humans were equal, and that something happened to change the situation.

Quite remarkable at a time of pecking orders and rituals of social deference.

All search were men who had all their needs taken care of by servants.

At a time when Europeans suddenly found themselves in control of the world and exposed to civilizations like China and India.

All the new ideas became known as the enlightenment.

Pretended ideas originated in Europe, but actually came from overseas. example,western bureaucracy models Chinese bureaucracy.

Many ideas came from North America, but were reframed as projections.

Americans developed a critique of Europe, which Europeans took seriously

Social inequality would not have been understood in the middle ages. The word did not even exist as a concept.

Equality arose out of debates on "natural law".

Natural Based on simple societies. not Aztecs or Maya.Or income

Middle ages had some idea of equality, egalitarianism.With festivals like Carnival Where the world was turned upside down?

American intellectuals existed.This seems to have been denied.By Western historians.Should not be taken seriously. Cannot compare this Cicero or erasmus.

The recent so many key enlightenment thinkers insisted that their ideals of individual liberty and political equality were inspired by Native American sources and examples. because it was true,

### In which we consider what the inhabitants of New France made of their European invaders, Especially matters of generosity, combat sociability, material wealth, crime, punishment and Liberty ~ p37 ~ 6%

Mi'kmaq:

You are always fighting and quarreling among yourselves; we live peaceably. you are envious and are all the time slandering each other; you are thieves and deceivers. you are covetous and are neither generous nor kind; As for us, we.If we have a morsel bread, we share it with our neighbors.

Personal freedom is inherently good

Indigenous Americans attitudes are likely to be far closer to the readers own than 17th century European ones.

Statesmen couldn't compel anyone to do anything they didn't wish to do

### In which we show how Europeans learn from Native Americans about the connection between reason debate, personal freedoms and the refusal of arbitrary power ~ p44 ~ 7%

### In which we introduce the Wendat philosopher statesman Kadiaronk and explain how his views On human nature and society took on new life in the salons of enlightenment in Europe, including an aside on the concept Schismogenesis ~ p48 ~ 7%

## Chapter 11 ~ p 441 ~ 63%

Indigenous critique ~

Portraying history as a story of material progress, that framework recasting Indigenous critics as innocent children of nature, whose views on freedom were in mere side effect of their uncultivated way of life and could not possibly offer a serious challenge to contemporary social thought (which came inreasingly to mean just European thought).
