>Dawn of Everything - A New History of Humanity

* https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374157357/thedawnofeverything

>A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.
>
>For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.
>
>Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.
>
>The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

> Graeber and Wengrow offer a history of the past 30,000 years that is not only wildly different from anything we’re used to, but also far more interesting: textured, surprising, paradoxical, inspiring.

>The authors introduce us to sumptuous Ice Age burials (the beadwork at one site alone is thought to have required 10,000 hours of work), as well as to monumental architectural sites like Göbekli Tepe, in modern Turkey, which dates from about 9000 B.C. (at least 6,000 years before Stonehenge) and features intricate carvings of wild beasts.

## Me

The book is written as a college course - the usual twelve or so chapters with thoughts of previous chapters refrained as reminders throughout

There are many quotable sequences - but they are unusually long -two or more sentences

Graeber offers no solutions, just plenty of hope

We are locked in by our vocabulary

Hobbes: best: modest control - but destiny

Rousseau: minor tinkering ~ but some free will

Rousseau & Hobbes: The path of least resistance leads the the hierarchical bureaucratic charismatic state
Gaeber: nope, that'a a myth

Pinker: more of the same as R & H ~ cities bring safety

## Definitions

Freedoms
* To move
* To disobey
* To rearrange social ties

Long Distance Interaction ~ p 23
* Dreams or vision Quests
* Traveling healers and entertainers
* Women's gambling

## Chapter 1 ~ page 1 ~

Most of history is lost

The world seems to be in a mess; was it alwalys like this?

Are we innately good or are we innately evil

Actually nonsensical question. We don't ask animals if they are good.

We were godlike, but now are in a fallen state

First: Jean-Jacques Rousseau ~ _Discourse on the Origin and the Fondation of Inequality among Mankind_ 1754

Child-like innocence until agricultural revolution
Then civilization, state
Then patriarchy, armies, executions, bureaucrats

Thomas Hobbes ~ _Leviathan_ ~ 1651

Primitive life: nasty, short and brutish

Progess: courts, bureaucracy, police

Human society is founded on collective repression - especially when large numbers

history is evolutionary

question of history: not equal access to resources but equal capacity to contribute to decisions how to live together

Graeber: Most accounts of history

* Simply isn't true
* Has dire political implications
* Makes the past needlessly dull

Hunter gatherers

* Bold social experiments
* Multitude of political forms
* Absence of private property
* Free of ranks and hierarchies

#### Truth

Need Radical shift

Forget: Social evolution, stages of development

Revisit: indigenous critique ~ take seriously social thought that is non-European

#### Politics


Diamond: Only primordial are egalitarian

Hierarchy is inevitable

Small groups not necessarily egalitarian; large groups must have rulers or bureaucracies

Pinker: pre-state people were violent

Early humans nurturing and caring

Early life more complex than modern theorist would guess

Democracy not liked befor 19th C

Has Western civilization made life better?

Impoverished history ~ simplification ~ reductionism ~ dulled down

Goods travel without market economy

Guesses we make are often far less interesting
Answers often unexpected and more playful
Foundation for a new world history
Origins of social inequality: not the biggest question
Move from European thinkers to indigenous thinkers

## Chapter 2 ~ p 27 ~ 4%

### Chapter 11 ~ p 441 ~ 63%

Indigenous critique ~

Portraying history as a story of material progress, that framework recasting Indigenous critics as innocent children of nature, whose views on freedom were in mere side effect of their uncultivated way of life and could not possibly offer a serious challenge to contemporary social thought (which came inreasingly to mean just European thought).

Grain states and barbarians ~ locked together in tension
But was the outcome inevitable

Older Scheme

* Band Societies
* Tribes
* Chiefdoms
* States

### Clans p455/6  ~ 66%

Long text on how indigenous Americans created and un-created state-like societies ~ based on lucid conscious critique


## Chapter 12 p493 ~ 71%
