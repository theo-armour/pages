# Dawn of Everything ~ Theo Notes

tags #book #history #anthropology


The book is written as a college course - the usual twelve or so chapters with thoughts of previous chapters refrained as reminders throughout

There are many quotable sequences - but they are unusually long - two or more sentences

Graeber offers no solutions, just plenty of hope

We are locked in by our vocabulary

Rousseau: minor tinkering ~ but some free will
Hobbes: best: modest control - but destiny

Rousseau & Hobbes: The path of least resistance leads the the hierarchical bureaucratic charismatic state
Graeber: nope, that's a myth

Pinker: more of the same as R & H ~ cities bring safety



## Chapter 1 ~ page 1 ~ 1% ~ This is not a book about the origins of inequality.

This is not a book about the origins of inequality

>This is the right time for metamorphosis, of fundamental principles and symbols. Jung

Most of history is lost. Little consequence for most people..

The world seems to be in a mess; was it always like this?

Theological question: Are we innately good or are we innately evil?

Actually nonsensical question. We don't ask animals if they are good.

"Good" and "evil" are concepts humans made up to compare ourselves with one another.

Original sin. We were godlike, but now are in a fallen state

First: Jean-Jacques Rousseau ~ _Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality among Mankind_ 1754

Child-like innocence until agricultural revolution
Then civilization, state
Then patriarchy, armies, executions, bureaucrats

Only other offer, even worse:

Thomas Hobbes ~ _Leviathan_ ~ 1651

p3 primitive life: nasty, short and brutish, repression of basic instincts.

Always: Alpha male, hierarchy and domination come, cynical self interest
Progress: courts, bureaucracy, police

Human society is founded on collective repression - especially when large numbers

history is evolutionary: wrong!

We don't like these choices!

Graeber: Most accounts of history

* Simply isn't true
* Has dire political implications
* Makes the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful

Hunter gatherers: bold social experiments.

Agriculture: relatively free of ranks and hierarchies.

p 4
World of hunter-gatherers:
* Bold social experiments
* Multitude of political forms
* Absence of private property
* Free of ranks and hierarchies

create a different world history.

conceptual shift is required

question of history: not equal access to resources but equal capacity to contribute to decisions how to live together

Need Radical shift

Forget: Social evolution, stages of development

Revisit: indigenous critique ~ take seriously social thought that is non-European


### p5 ~ Why both the Hobbesian and Rousseauian versions of human history have dire political implications

tags #inequality

Rousseau: Humankind descended To send it into inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence.

Moderns: social inequality is out of control

Modern thinking: even if it's unjust, a bit of tinkering might make it work.

Palatable to the rich. But to actual reformers, no solution is evident.

What does removing inequality mean?



Small groups not necessarily egalitarian; large groups must have rulers or bureaucracies.

An egalitarian society might be possible, but only if lived in a tiny band of foragers.

The ultimate question of human history is not equal access to material resources.But our equal capacity to contribute to decisions about how to live together.

We are projects of collective self creation. We must treat people from the beginning as a managership, intelligent, playful creatures who deserve to be understood as such?

We are so trapped that we cannot imagine reinventing ourselves

### Some brief examples of why received understandings of the broad sweep of human history are mostly wrong.Or the eternal return of Jean Jacques Rousseau.

The framing oh uhman history: humanity once existed in an idyllic state and that a specific point can be identified at which everything started to go wrong

Fukuyama : Haunting bands very egalitarian.
Pinker: pre-state people were violent

Diamond: Only primordial are egalitarian

Hierarchy is inevitable

For both, the invention of Agriculture puts an end to equality

Graeber: There is no reason to believe that small groups were egalitarian, or that large ones must necessarily have kings presidents or even bureaucracies.

### p11 ~ On the pursuit of Happiness

p14
Early humans nurturing and caring

Early life more complex than modern theorist would guess

p17
Democracy not liked before 19th C

Has Western civilization made life better?

Impoverished history ~ simplification ~ reductionism ~ dulled down

p18
People return to tribal life

### p21 ~ How to conventional narrative of human history is not only wrong, but quite needlessly dull

Standard history reduces people to cardboard stereotypes.

When we impoverished history, we impoverished our sense of possibility.

p22 primitive trade

Goods travel without market economy

Long distance interruption spheres
* Dreams or vision quests
* traveling healers and entertainers.
* Women's gambling

Guesses we make are often far less interesting

### p24 ~ On What's To Follow

New science of history

Answers often unexpected and more playful

Foundation for a new world history
Something has been lost
Discover right questions
"What is the origin of social inequality?": if not the biggest question, then what is?
Move from European thinkers to indigenous thinkers

## Chapter 2 ~ Wicked liberty ~ the indigenous critique and the myth of progress. ~ p 27 ~ 4%

Departure from pristine simplicity

Great Man theory of history

### In which we show how critiques of eurcentrism can backfire and end up turning aboriginal thinkers into soft puppets.

Dijon: essay competition on the question: what is the origin of inequality among men, And is it authorized by natural law?

Assumed inequality did have an origin and that there was a time when humans were equal, and that something happened to change the situation.

Quite remarkable at a time of pecking orders and rituals of social deference.

All search were men who had all their needs taken care of by servants.

At a time when Europeans suddenly found themselves in control of the world and exposed to civilizations like China and India.

All the new ideas became known as the enlightenment.

Pretended ideas originated in Europe, but actually came from overseas. example,western bureaucracy models Chinese bureaucracy.

Many ideas came from North America, but were reframed as projections.

Americans developed a critique of Europe, which Europeans took seriously

Social inequality would not have been understood in the middle ages. The word did not even exist as a concept.

Equality arose out of debates on "natural law".

Natural Based on simple societies. not Aztecs or Maya.Or income

Middle ages had some idea of equality, egalitarianism.With festivals like Carnival Where the world was turned upside down?

American intellectuals existed.This seems to have been denied.By Western historians.Should not be taken seriously. Cannot compare this Cicero or erasmus.

The recent so many key enlightenment thinkers insisted that their ideals of individual liberty and political equality were inspired by Native American sources and examples. because it was true,

### In which we consider what the inhabitants of New France made of their European invaders, Especially matters of generosity, combat sociability, material wealth, crime, punishment and Liberty ~ p37 ~ 6%

Mi'kmaq:

You are always fighting and quarreling among yourselves; we live peaceably. you are envious and are all the time slandering each other; you are thieves and deceivers. you are covetous and are neither generous nor kind; As for us, we.If we have a morsel bread, we share it with our neighbors.

Personal freedom is inherently good

Indigenous Americans attitudes are likely to be far closer to the readers own than 17th century European ones.

Statesmen couldn't compel anyone to do anything they didn't wish to do

### In which we show how Europeans learn from Native Americans about the connection between reason debate, personal freedoms and the refusal of arbitrary power ~ p44 ~ 7%

### In which we introduce the Wendat philosopher statesman Kadiaronk and explain how his views On human nature and society took on new life in the salons of enlightenment in Europe, including an aside on the concept Schismogenesis ~ p48 ~ 7%

### In which we explained that Demiurgic powers of ARJ Turgot and how he turned the indigenous Critique of European civilization on its head, laying the palaces for most modern views of social evolution., or how an argument about freedom became one about equality ~ p59 ~ 9%

### How Jean Jacques Rousseau, having won one prestigious estate competition, then lost another (coming in over the permitted word length), but finally went on to Conquer the whole of human history ~ p63 ~ 10%

### In which we consider relationships between the indigenous critiques, the myth of progress and the birth of the left ~ p67 ~ 10%

## Chapter 4 ~ Free people, the origin of cultures, and the advent of private property ~ p120 ~ 18%

p121 ~ we are far more interesting than we are sometimes inclined to imagine

* Free to travel
* free to move between different social structured ~ freedom to reorganize social structures
* Free to disobey

property existed but according to different concepts

Foragers were able to form priestly castes and royal courts

Academic thought: write off prosperous foragers as "quirks"

Cultures centred on abundance

monuments were sacred spaces

Ritual and intellectual property protected by secrecy

Private property and the notion of the sacred

Roman Law: Three Basic rights relating to possession
* _Usus_ ~ the right to use
* _Fructus_ ~ the right to enjoy
* _Abusus_ ~ the right to destroy

Sacred objects were the only objects treated as private property

The defining feature of property: one has the option of not taking care of it or even destroying it at will

p162 Private property starts out as sacred property

p180 schismogenesis

Each society a mirror image of the other ~ alter ego

### On the historical foundations of the indigenous critique

Portraying history as a story of material progress, that framework recasting Indigenous critics as innocent children of nature, whose views on freedom were in mere side effect of their uncultivated way of life and could not possibly offer a serious challenge to contemporary social thought (which came inreasingly to mean just European thought).

indigenous critique: long foundation in Europe + backlash

History portrayed as material progress - grew larger > more complex > more hierarchical > influences generations of historians

from tiny bands to capitalists nation states
Anything that does not fit in with this story can be ignored.
Thus much history disappears

### In which we consider James C Scott's arguments about the last 5000 years and ask whether current global arrangements were, in fact, inevitable. ~ p443 ~ 64%

Last 2,000 years mostly hierarchical

Epochs of relative freedom become dark ages (ie Egypt)

Arguments:
hierarchy inevitable, it just may take linger in places
Or it takes the right combo og guns, germs and steel

Wheat, barley millet drive agriculture
* visible, storable, taxable

Barbaric "Heroic" vs valley farmer societies = dark twins

Grain states and barbarians ~ locked together in tension
But was the outcome inevitable
about have the population could move

Now cannot move. sovereignty, admin an charisma rule. Was this the necessary culmination?

Older Scheme says
* Band societies
* Tribes
* Chiefdoms
* States

Terms still used, because
difficult to imagine history that is not teleological - which does not imply current arrangements are inevitable

EurAsia: Dramatic changes appear to have occured in a coordinated fashion

But we can compare EurAsia and the Americas

Example Cahokia

Not like Europe, so different that real dialog is impossible

example: dream-guessing


### In which we ask, how much of North America came to have a single uniform plan system, and the role of the "Hopewell interaction sphere" ~ p455/6 ~ 66%

Long text on how indigenous Americans created and un-created state-like societies ~ based on lucid conscious critique

Clans everywhere on "Turtle Island" - consistent alliances

Unlikely to have been brought over from Siberia ~ must be more recent

Not kinship groups

Ritual societies
Cannot marry within ~ matriarchal
No ancestor colts ~ no property ~ only ritual knowledge
Fixed list of names
Communities never just one clan

Designed so people could move or reshuffle social arrangements

Origins in in rituals and diplomacy

p457 Ties developed at "Hopewell Interaction Sphere"

### In which we tell the story of Cahokia, which looks likes it ought to be the first "state" in America ~ p463 ~ 67%

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunkey


### On how the collapse of the Mississippian World and rejection of its legacy opened the way to new forms of indigenous politics around the time of the European invasion ~ P471 ~ 68%

small towns with egalitarian structures

Role of tobacco ~ influence on Europe

### How the Osage came to embody the principle of self constitution, later to be celebrated in Montesquieu's _The Spirit of the Laws_.

M probably met with Americans.

### In which we return to Iroquoia and consider the political Philosophies likely to have been familiar to Kandiaronk in his youth ~ p481 ~ 69%

Backlash against Cahokia set forth repercussions we still feel today.

The way Americans behaved was not how all humans can be expected to behave. No the way the cookie crumbled

Societies Europeans first encountered only make sense when you consider a specific political history
* Questions hereditary power
* Revealed religion
* Personal freedom
* Independence of women


## Chapter 12 ~ Conclusion ~ p493 ~ 71%

### The dawn of everything

#### Myth

Book began with appeal to ask better questions

Inquiring about origins of inequality requires creation of a myth

Book of genesis

Best we can hope for: modest tinkering with inherently squalid condition
or
no origins of inequality, we are thuggish, progress driven forward by our selfish, competitive nature

First view more popular. Rosy narrative that Western civ inevitably makes everyone happier

#### p493 But!
Fails to explain why were European powers forced people to accept their ways for 500 years

if being savage was so bad why did Westerners embrace American life?

#### p493 19thC aware
19th C people seemed aware of the predicament.

Heyday of march of progress - 19thC - was time when peeps were obsesses with decadence and disintegration.

Enlightenment era had been naive

#### p494 Questions
Social sciences were concerned
1. What had gone wrong with Enlightenment - with schemes for improving society?
2. Why did so many well-meaning attempts to fix problems end up making worse?

Why did the passion for liberty, equality and fraternity end up produciung the terror

#### p494 Rousseau


p494 modern social science comes frome Vicomte de Bonald & Edmund Burke

p495 Left heart enlightenment; right are critics


p495 Only modern people had capacity to intervene in history and change its course

non-modern-folk: too simple minded to attribute self-conscious social projects

p496 anthropologists describe societies as being in a eternal present.

British in Asia: change was illegal

p496 Mircea Eliade

Traditional societies: Everything important has already happened.

Modern: linear societies

p498 Social science a study in ways which humans are not free

p500 Ritual play
* Scientific laboratory
* repertory of knowledge and techniques

Is there a positive correlation between "gender equality" (women's freedom) and the degree of innovation in a society

Choosing to describe history, the other way around, as a series of abrupt technological revolutions, each followed by long periods when we were prisoners of our own creationist, has consequences.Ultimately, it is a very rapid dissenting or species, as decidedly less thoughtful, less creative, less free than we actually turn out to have been.

p502 Things get complicated

p502
1. The freedom to move away or relocate from surroundings
2. The freedom to ignore or disobey commands issued by others.
3. the freedom to shape entirely new social realities or shift back and forth between different ones.

The only kings were play kings

Now. We can barely comprehend what it might be like to live in a social order based on them.

p504 There is no way out of the imagined order.

Most people who write history on the ground scale seem to have decided that, as a species, we are well and truly stuck. And there is no real escape from the institutional gages we've made for ourselves.

War

p506 Was there a relationship between external warfare and the internal lost freedoms that opened the way, first two systems of ranking and the later on to large scale systems of domination.

p508 You should write connection between patriarchal household and military might?

Existing debates are derived from Roman law.

Roman laws trace back to slave law

Absolute power over Slaves

p510 "family" root is Latin famulus meaning "house slave"

Domus or "house" from dominium or "sovereignty

Iroquois - violence toward enemy ~ Europe violence against ones own people

p511 All Wendat wars were "mourning wars"



p512 only some historical periods were violent - other times there was general peace

Werndat appalled by French killing their own people

p513 Indian households the opposite of Romans

Romans: violence a form of love
Wendat: no violence within the community

France similar to Rome

King James I: True Law of Free Monarchies


Common model of subordination

p514 The connection between care and domination is critical

received wisdom: population scaling up by orders of magnitude corresponds to social and spatial hierarchies

Critical to understand how we got stuck so can't see anything other than moving from cage to cage

Have only mapped what we think really happened but only highlight flaws in other scholars arguments

Most stubborn misconception: domination is inevitable result of scaling up population or borders by orders of magnitude

"complexity" often euphemism for "hierarchy"

None of these assumptions ae essential

p515 Crumley: complex systems do
not have to be organized top-down

p516
no: rise of urban life means surrendering freedom and submitting to rule

What preceded cities was networks of societies

amphictyony (plural amphictyonies) A religious foundation or co-operative shared between Greek city states during the classical period, typically to support the temple or cult of a deity shared by the city states. Also used academically to refer to similar arrangements in non-Greek cultures

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphictyonic_league

cities were confederacies compressed into a small space

Hereditary aristocracies just as likely to form in small groups

p518 Kings and slaves inhabit the same ground: both have no kin

First factories: charitable institutions but leads to degradation of women

p519 ~ How did we find ourselves stuck in just one form of social reality, and how did relations based ultimately earn violence and domination come to be normalized within it?

Franz Steiner

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Baermann_Steiner

What happens when freedom of movement, hospitality and abode erode?

If stateless societies regularly organize themselves but chiefs have no power
Perhaps goes back to charity. Chief's residence becomes a sanctuary.

the process of giving refuge transforms domestic arrangements

p520 Attracts freakish or detached - everywhere


p521 our research began as a form of play

how new archeological evidence might change notions of history

searched in vain

p522 perhaps because of lack of language
Lack of appropriate language

words ike "democracy" have so much historical baggage

What do you call a city that lacks a top-down structure?

we are at a loss for words when confronted with certain major aspects of human history

p523
Recalibrate the scales

The majority of human history is without slavery or war: free societies

Slavery abolished multiple times. Ditto war

the periods of free societies represents the majority of existence

Perhaps the future will rewrite history

We could have been living in radically different conceptions of what human society is about

the possibilities for human intervention are greater then we are inclined to think


p524

Are we at a time of "kairos" a time in which events prone to happen, when frameworks shift?

Scientists not discovering new science, but they are discovering new history.

The purpose of this new knowledge is to reshape our conceptopns


p525 Myth gives structure

old axioms: scattering like mice

To rediscover the meaning of our third basic freedom, the freedom to create new and different forms of social reality.

All societies have science. Ditto myth.

Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and meaning to experience.


Be careful: The ending is a trick:

"In fact, we have already taken the first step. We can see more clearly now what is going on when, for example, a study that is rigorous in every other respect begins from the unexamined assumption that the.Some “original” form of human society; that its nature was fundamentally good or evil; that at a time before an inequality and political awareness existed, that something happened to change all this; that "civilization" and "complexity" always came at the price of human freedoms; that participatory democracy is natural in small groups, but cannot possibly scale up to anything like a city or a nation state."

"We know, now, that we are in the presence of myths"
