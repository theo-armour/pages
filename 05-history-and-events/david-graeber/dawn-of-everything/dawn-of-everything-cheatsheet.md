### Myths

a study that is rigorous in every other respect begins from the unexamined assumption
* that there was some “original” form of human society
* that its nature was fundamentally good or evil
* that at a time before an inequality and political awareness existed
* that something happened to change all this
* that "civilization" and "complexity" always came at the price of human freedoms
* that participatory democracy is natural in small groups, but cannot possibly scale up to anything like a city or a nation state
