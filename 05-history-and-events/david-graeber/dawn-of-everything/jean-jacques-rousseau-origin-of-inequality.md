p16
>Once upon a time, the story goes, we were hunter-gatherers, living in a prolonged state of childlike innocence, in tiny bands. These bands were egalitarian; they could be for the very reason that they were so small. It was only after the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, and then still more the rise of cities, that this happy condition came to an end, ushering in ‘civilization’ and ‘the state’ – which also meant the appearance of written literature, science and philosophy, but at the same time, almost everything bad in human life: patriarchy, standing armies, mass executions and annoying bureaucrats demanding that we spend much of our lives filling in forms

p17
> Rousseau was complaining about: governments, courts, bureaucracies, police.

p19
> Rousseau’s story about how humankind descended into inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence seems more optimistic (at least there was somewhere better to fall from), but nowadays it’s mostly deployed to convince us that while the system we live under might be unjust, the most we can realistically aim for is a bit of modest
tinkering.

p21
> in the days of Rousseau,
that in such societies ‘everyone was equal, because they were all equally poor.’

p23
> Rousseau was largely correct in pointing out that the origin of political inequality lay in the development of agriculture, since hunter-gatherer societies (according to Fukuyama) have no concept of private property, and so little incentive to mark out a piece of land and say, ‘This is mine.’ Band-level societies of this sort, he suggests, are ‘highly egalitarian’

p23
> For Diamond and Fukuyama, as for Rousseau some centuries earlier, what put an end to that equality – everywhere and forever – was the invention of agriculture, and the higher population levels it sustained. Agriculture brought about a transition from ‘bands’ to ‘tribes’. Accumulation of food surplus fed population growth, leading some ‘tribes’ to develop into ranked societies known as ‘chiefdoms’

p25
> As we say, it’s all just an endless repetition of a story first told by Rousseau in 1754. Many contemporary scholars will quite literally say that Rousseau’s vision has been proved correct. If so, it is an extraordinary coincidence, since Rousseau himself never suggested that the innocent State of Nature really happened. On the contrary, he insisted he was engaging in a thought experiment: ‘One must not take the kind of research which we enter into as the pursuit of truths of history, but solely as hypothetical and conditional reasonings, better fitted to clarify the nature of things than to expose their actual origin...

 Rousseau’s portrayal of the State of Nature and how it was overturned by the coming of agriculture was never intended to form the basis for a series of evolutionary stages, like the ones Scottish philosophers such as Smith, Ferguson or Millar (and later on, Lewis Henry Morgan) were referring to when they spoke of ‘Savagery’ and ‘Barbarism’. In no sense was Rousseau imagining these different states of being as levels of social and moral development, corresponding to historical changes in modes of production: foraging, pastoralism, farming, industry. Rather, what Rousseau presented was more of a parable, by way of an attempt to explore a fundamental paradox of human politics: how is it that our innate drive for freedom somehow leads us, time and again, on a ‘spontaneous march to inequality

Describing how the invention of farming first leads to private property, and property to the need for civil government to protect it, this is how Rousseau puts things: ‘All ran towards their chains, believing that they were securing their liberty; for although they had reason enough to discern the advantages of a civil order, they did not have experience enough to foresee the dangers.’ His imaginary State of Nature was primarily invoked as a way of illustrating the point. True, he didn’t invent the concept: as a rhetorical device, the State of Nature had already been used in European philosophy for a century. Widely deployed by natural law theorists, it effectively allowed every thinker interested in the origins of government (Locke, Grotius and so on) to play God, each coming up with his own variant on humanity’s original condition, as a springboard for speculation.

p28
> When it comes to cherry-picking anthropological case studies, and putting them forward as representative of our ‘contemporary ancestors’ – that is, as models for what humans might have been like in a State of Nature – those working in the tradition of Rousseau tend to prefer African foragers like the Hadza, Pygmies or !Kung. Those who follow Hobbes prefer the Yanomami.

p30
> For obvious reasons, Hobbes’s position tends to be favoured by those on the right of the political spectrum, and Rousseau’s by those leaning left.

p34
> Hobbes and Rousseau told their contemporaries things that were
startling, profound and opened new doors of the imagination. Now their
ideas are just tired common sense. There’s nothing in them that justifies the
continued simplification of human affairs. If social scientists today continue
to reduce past generations to simplistic, two-dimensional caricatures, it is
not so much to show us anything original, but just because they feel that’s
what social scientists are expected to do so as to appear ‘scientific’. The
actual result is to impoverish history – and as a consequence, to impoverish
our sense of possibility.

p38
>, Rousseau
was not entirely mistaken. Something has been lost. He just had a rather
idiosyncratic (and ultimately, false) notion of what it was. How do we
characterize it, then?

p38
> In the end, we decided to write a
book that would echo, to some degree at least, that evolution in our own
thought. In those conversations, the real breakthrough moment came when
we decided to move away from European thinkers like Rousseau entirely,
and instead consider perspectives that derive from those indigenous thinkers
who ultimately inspired them.

p40
> Jean-Jacques Rousseau left us a story about the origins of social inequality
that continues to be told and retold, in endless variations, to this day. It is
the story of humanity’s original innocence, and unwitting departure from a
state of pristine simplicity on a voyage of technological discovery that
would ultimately guarantee both our ‘complexity’ and our enslavement.

> All this applies to Rousseau. Intellectual historians sometimes write as if
Rousseau had personally kicked off the debate about social inequality with
his 1754 Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among
Mankind. In fact, he wrote it to submit to an essay contest on the subject.

p41
> They lived off the
patronage of dukes and archbishops, and rarely entered a building without
knowing the precise order of importance of everyone inside. Rousseau was
one such man: an ambitious young philosopher, he was at the time engaged
in an elaborate project of trying to sleep his way into influence at court. The
closest he’d likely ever come to experiencing social equality himself was
someone doling out equal slices of cake at a dinner party. Yet everyone at
the time also agreed that this situation was somehow unnatural; that it had
not always been that way

p49
> e will examine early missionary and travel accounts from New France
– especially the Great Lakes region – since these were the accounts
Rousseau himself was most familiar with, to get a sense of what its
indigenous inhabitants did actually think of French society, and how they
came to think of their own societies differently as a result. We will argue
that indigenous Americans did indeed develop a very strong critical view of
their invaders’ institutions: a view which focused first on these institutions’
lack of freedom, and only later, as they became more familiar with
European social arrangements, on equality.

p74
> The exchange between Madame de Graffigny and Turgot gives us a sense
of intellectual debate in France in the early 1750s; at least, in the saloniste
circles with which Rousseau was familiar. Were freedom and equality
universal values, or were they – at least in their pure form – inconsistent
with a regime based on private property? Did the progress of arts and
sciences lead to improved understanding of the world, and therefore to
moral progress as well? Or was the indigenous critique correct, and the
wealth and power of France simply a perverse side effect of unnatural, even
pathological, social arrangements? These were the questions on every
debater’s lips at the time.
If we know anything about those debates today, it’s largely because of
their influence on Rousseau’s essay. The Discourse on the Origins of Social
Inequality has been taught, debated and picked apart in a thousand
classrooms – which is odd, because in many ways it is very much an
eccentric outlier, even by the standards of its time.

**p75 - p84**
> In the early part of his life, Rousseau was known mainly as an aspiring
composer. His rise to prominence as a social thinker began in 1750, when
he took part in a contest sponsored by the same learned society, the
Académie de Dijon, on the question, ‘Has the restoration of the sciences
and arts contributed to moral improvement?’46 Rousseau won first prize,
and national fame, with an essay in which he argued with great passion that
they had not. Our elementary moral intuitions, he asserted, are
fundamentally decent and sound; civilization merely corrupts by
encouraging us to value form over content. Almost all the examples in this
Discourse on the Arts and Sciences are taken from classical Greek and
Roman sources – but in his footnotes, Rousseau hints at other sources of
inspiration:

I don’t dare speak of those happy nations who do not know even the
names of the vices which we have such trouble controlling, of those
American savages whose simple and natural ways of keeping public
order Montaigne does not hesitate to prefer, not merely to the laws
of Plato, but even to anything more perfect which philosophy will
ever be able to dream up for governing a people. He cites a number
of striking examples of these for those who understand how to
admire them. What’s more, he says, they don’t wear breeches!

On for several pages. Come back here!

p97
> As Christopher Boehm puts it,
we seem doomed to play out an endless recycling of the war between
‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’: those who view humans as
either innately hierarchical or innately egalitarian.

p98
> The solution to
the battle between ‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’ turns out to
be: our genetic nature is Hobbesian, but our political history is pretty much
exactly as described by Rousseau. The result? An odd insistence that for
many tens of thousands of years, nothing happened.

p103
> In the last chapter, we suggested that the really insidious element of
Rousseau’s legacy is not so much the idea of the ‘noble savage’ as that of
the ‘stupid savage’.

p112
> The image of tiny egalitarian bands corresponded perfectly to
what those weaned on the legacy of Rousseau felt hunter-gatherers ought to
have been like. Now there seemed to be hard, quantifiable scientific data
(and also movies!) to back it up.

p122
> Chiefs found themselves in this situation, Clastres argued, because they
weren’t the only ones who were mature and insightful political actors;
almost everyone was. Rather than being trapped in some sort of
Rousseauian innocence, unable to imagine more complex forms of
organization, people were generally more capable than we are of imagining
alternative social orders, and therefore had created ‘societies against the
state’. They had self-consciously organized in such a way that the forms of
arbitrary power and domination we associate with ‘advanced political
systems’ could never possibly emerge.

p123
> Still, most of it
was based on firm Rousseauian ground, insisting Clastres was ascribing too
much imagination to ‘primitive’ or ‘archaic’ people who, almost by
definition, shouldn’t have any. How could one possibly claim, so such
criticism went, that stateless societies were self-consciously organizing
themselves to prevent the emergence of something they’d never actually
experienced?

p123
>Now, both the neoevolutionists who saw ‘primitive’ folk as Rousseauian naïfs and the radicals
who insisted they were self-conscious egalitarians equally took it for
granted they were stuck in a single, very simple mode of social existence

p128
>. If nothing else, surely the time has come to stop the
swinging pendulum that has fixated generations of philosophers, historians
and social scientists, leading their gaze from Hobbes to Rousseau, from
Rousseau to Hobbes and back again. We do not have to choose any more
between an egalitarian or hierarchical start to the human story. Let us bid
farewell to the ‘childhood of Man’ and acknowledge (as Lévi-Strauss
insisted) that our early ancestors were not just our cognitive equals, but our
intellectual peers too

p128
> Was this really a consequence of adopting agriculture? Of
settling down in permanent villages and, later, towns? Should we be
looking for a moment in time like the one Rousseau envisaged, when
somebody first enclosed a tract of land, declaring: ‘This is mine and always
will be!’ Or is that another fool’s errand?

p136
>There’s only one way out of this dilemma: to create some sort of
universal, objective standards by which to measure equality. Since the time
of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, this has almost invariably
meant focusing on property arrangements. As we’ve seen, it was only at
this point, in the mid to late eighteenth century, that European philosophers
first came up with the idea of ranking human societies according to their
means of subsistence, and therefore that hunter-gatherers should be treated
as a distinct variety of human being, As we’ve also seen, this idea is very
much still with us. But so is Rousseau’s argument that it was only the
invention of agriculture that introduced genuine inequality, since it allowed
for the emergence of landed property. This is one of the main reasons
people today continue to write as if foragers can be assumed to live in
egalitarian bands to begin with – because it’s also assumed that without the
productive assets (land, livestock) and stockpiled surpluses (grain, wool,
dairy products, etc.) made possible by farming, there was no real material
basis for anyone to lord it over anyone else.

p137
> Conventional wisdom also tells us that the moment a material surplus
does become possible, there will also be full-time craft specialists, warriors
and priests laying claim to it, and living off some portions of that surplus
(or, in the case of warriors, spending the bulk of their time trying to figure
out new ways to steal it from each other); and before long, merchants,
lawyers and politicians will inevitably follow. These new elites will, as
Rousseau emphasized, band together to protect their assets, so the advent of
private property will be followed, inexorably, by the rise of ‘the state’.

p139
> Far from rushing blindly for their chains like Rousseau’s savages,
Woodburn’s ‘immediate return hunter-gatherers’ understand precisely
where the chains of captivity loom, and organize much of their lives to keep
away from them. This might sound like the basis of something hopeful or
optimistic. Actually, it’s anything but. What it suggests is, again, that any
equality worth the name is essentially impossible for all but the very
simplest foragers. What kind of future might we then have in store?

p145
> Sahlins’s essay, perhaps the last truly great example of that genre of
‘speculative prehistory’ invented by Rousseau, first appeared in Jean-Paul
Sartre’s journal Les Temps modernes.
18 It made the argument that, at least
when it comes to working hours, the Victorian narrative of continual
improvement is simply backwards. Technological evolution has not
liberated people from material necessity. People are not working less. All
the evidence, he argued, suggests that over the course of human history the
overall number of hours most people spend working has tended instead to
increase. Even more provocatively, Sahlins insisted that people in earlier
ages were not, necessarily, poorer than modern-day consumers. In fact, he
contended, for much of our early history humans might just as easily be
said to have lived lives of great material abundance.

p147
>  Like Woodburn, Sahlins
brushes aside Rousseau’s version of the Fall – the idea that, too foolish to
reflect on the likely consequences of our actions in assembling, stockpiling
and guarding property, we ‘ran blindly for our chains’22 – and takes us
straight back to the Garden of Eden. If rejecting farming was a conscious
choice, then so was that act of embracing it. We chose to eat of the fruit of
the tree of knowledge, and for this we were punished. As St Augustine put
it, we rebelled against God, and God’s judgment was to cause our own
desires to rebel against our rational good sense; our punishment for original
sin is the infinity of our new desires

p222
> This is not only untrue (very few of those who dismiss her work
seem to have actually read any of it), but it has created a situation where
scholars find it difficult even to speculate as to how hierarchy and
exploitation came to take root in the domestic sphere – unless one wants to
return to Rousseau, and the simplistic notion that settled farming somehow
automatically generated the power of husbands over wives and fathers over
children.

p243
 No form of human ecology is
‘innately’ egalitarian, but much as Rousseau and his epigones would have
been surprised to hear it, these early cultivation systems did not lend
themselves to the development of private property. If anything, flood-retreat
farming was practically oriented towards the collective holding of land, or
at least flexible systems of field reallocation.

p277
> Until quite recently, Amazonia was regarded as a timeless refuge of solitary
tribes, about as close to Rousseau or Hobbes’s State of Nature as one could
possibly get. As we’ve seen, such romantic notions persisted in
anthropology well into the 1980s, through studies that cast groups like the
Yanomami in the role of ‘contemporary ancestors’, windows on to our
evolutionary past. Research in the fields of archaeology and ethnohistory is
now overturning this picture.

p279
> And in both cases, they look increasingly unrevolutionary. In the beginning, many of the world’s farming societies were
Amazonian in spirit. They hovered at the threshold of agriculture while
remaining wedded to the cultural values of hunting and foraging. The
‘smiling fields’ of Rousseau’s Discourse still lay far off in the future.

p363
> Spanish observers may even have learned from Tlaxcalteca or Aztec
sources what it means to have once been a ‘noble savage’. Nor can we rule
out the possibility that indigenous Mexican ideas on the subject entered
wider streams of European political thought that gathered force only in the
days of Rousseau, whose State of Nature maps with alarming fidelity on to
Motolinía’s account of the Chichimec, right down to the ‘primitive hut
dwellings’ in which they were supposed to have lived. Perhaps some of the
seeds of our own evolutionary story about how it all began with simple,
egalitarian hunter-gatherers were sow

p367
> As soon as one has a group of people
living routinely off the labour of another, the argument ran, they will
necessarily create an apparatus of rule, officially to protect their property
rights, in reality to preserve their advantage (a line of thinking very much in
the tradition of Rousseau). This definition brought Babylon, Athens and
medieval England back into the fold, but also introduced new conceptual
problems, such as how to define exploitation. And it was unpalatable to
liberals, ruling out any possibility that the state could ever become a
benevolent institution.

p369
> Recall how Rousseau, in his famous thought experiment, felt that
everything went back to private property, and especially property in land: in
that terrible moment when a man first threw up a barrier and said, ‘This
territory is mine, and mine alone’, all subsequent forms of domination – and
therefore, all subsequent catastrophes – became inevitable. As we’ve seen,
this obsession with property rights as the basis of society, and as a
foundation of social power, is a peculiarly Western phenomenon – indeed, if
‘the West’ has any real meaning, it would probably refer to that legal and
intellectual tradition which conceives society in those terms.

p496
> If nothing else, these preoccupations help to explain the continued
relevance of an otherwise not particularly successful eighteenth-century
Swiss musician named Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Those primarily concerned
with the first question saw him as the first to ask it in a quintessentially
modern way. Those mainly concerned with the second were able to
represent him as the ultimate clueless villain, a simple-minded
revolutionary who felt that the established order, being irrational, could
simply be brushed aside. Many held Rousseau personally responsible for
the guillotine. By contrast, few nowadays read the ‘traditionalists’ of the
nineteenth century, but they’re actually important since it is they, not the
Enlightenment philosophes, who are really responsible for modern social
theory. It’s long been recognized that almost all the great issues of modern
social science – tradition, solidarity, authority, status, alienation, the sacred
– were first raised in the works of men like the theocratic Vicomte de
Bonald, the monarchist Comte de Maistre, or the Whig politician and
philosopher Edmund Burke as examples of the kind of stubborn social
realities which they felt that Enlightenment thinkers, and Rousseau in
particular, had refused to take seriously, with (they insisted) disastrous
results.

p505
>‘There is no way out of the imagined order,’ writes Yuval Noah Harari in
his book Sapiens. ‘When we break down our prison walls and run towards
freedom’, he goes on, ‘we are in fact running into the more spacious
exercise yard of a bigger prison.’5
 As we saw in our first chapter, he is not
alone in reaching this conclusion. Most people who write history on a grand
scale seem to have decided that, as a species, we are well and truly stuck
and there is really no escape from the institutional cages we’ve made for
ourselves. Harari, once again echoing Rousseau, seems to have captured the
prevailing mood.

p505
> The most we can offer are some
preliminary suggestions, or points of departure, based on the arguments
presented in this book; and perhaps we can also begin to see more clearly
where others since the time of Rousseau have been going wrong.

p528
> Still, even when anthropologists, archaeologists and
historians try their hand at ‘big-picture’ narratives, they have an
odd tendency to end up with some similarly minor variation on
Rousseau.

p528
> For Rousseau, by contrast,
what humans make, they could always unmake, or at least do
differently. We could free ourselves from the chains that bind us;
it just wasn’t going to be easy

p529
> modern-day counterparts to the great
social philosophers of the Enlightenment, men like Hobbes and
Rousseau, playing out the same grand dialogue but with a more
accurate cast of characters

p534
> One of Rousseau’s rivals in the essay contest, the Marquis
d’Argenson, who also failed to win a prize, made precisely this
argument: monarchy allowed the truest equality, he argued, and
absolutist monarchy most of all, since everyone is equal before
the absolute power of the king.

p535
> Lahontan’s Dialogues (to which we shortly turn) in a literary
class with works by Diderot and Rousseau, writers who had little
if any direct experience of Native American peoples but invoked
them as a ‘discursively constructed Other with which to
interrogate European customs and civilization’.

p539
> Rousseau described himself as an avid reader of travelogues and
does cite Lebeau, who is basically summarizing Lahontan, as well
as l’Arlequin sauvage

p540
> Rousseau himself had fled home at an early age, writing to his
Swiss watchmaker father that he aspired to live ‘without the help
of others’.

p540
> but in a
way it hardly matters, since the main point is that the right wing
saw Rousseauian ideas as inspiring leftist revolutionary activity.

p540
> The key difference is that Rousseau sees progress as undermining
an essentially benevolent human nature, while classic
conservative thought tends to see it as having undermined
traditional mores and forms of authority which had previously
been able to contain the less benevolent aspects of human nature.

p541
> Lahontan opens the way
not just for Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but for Father Duchesne and
the modern socialist revolutionaries, and all that just ten years
before the death of Louis XIV

p541
> ‘His imagination paints no pictures; his heart makes no demands
on him. His few wants are so readily supplied, and he is so far
from having the knowledge which is needful to make him want
more, that he can have neither foresight nor curiosity … His soul,
which nothing disturbs, is wholly wrapped up in the feeling of its
present existence, without any idea of the future, however near at
hand; while his projects, as limited as his views, hardly extend to
the close of day. Such, even at present, is the extent of the native
Caribbean’s foresight: he will improvidently sell you his cottonbed in the morning, and come crying in the evening to buy it
again, not having foreseen he would want it again the next night.’
(Rousseau 1

p551
> At the same time, though, medieval authorities were keenly aware of the fact that most peasant revolts or urban insurrections would begin precisely during such ritual moments. This ambivalence appears again and again. Rousseau already considered the popular festival to embody the spirit of revolution. Such ideas were later developed in Roger Caillois’s seminal essay on ‘the festival’, written for George Bataille’s Collège de Sociologie

p632
> On reflection, many of what we consider to be quintessential freedoms – such as ‘freedom of speech’ or ‘the pursuit of happiness’ – are not really social freedoms at all. You can be free to say whatever you like, but if nobody cares or listens, it hardly matters. Equally, you can be as happy as you like, but if that happiness comes at the price of another’s misery, it hardly amounts to much either. Arguably, the things often quoted as quintessential freedoms are based on the very illusion created by Rousseau in his second Discourse: the illusion of a human life that is solitary.
