The DBpedia ontology is the heart of DBpedia. Having started as a manually created ontology based on the most commonly used infoboxes within Wikipedia in 2008, it soon evolved into a successful crowd-sourcing effort resulting in a shallow cross-domain ontology.

>DBpedia is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (OKG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search. We hope that this work will make it easier for the huge amount of information in Wikimedia projects to be used in some new interesting ways.

>DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That’s the kind of query we are talking about.

* Much easier to use than Dewey Decimal or LoC
* Finding where a new item can fit into the tree looks to be kind of easy
* Wiktionary also has a tree sometimes that may help
* It wil be easier to find examples of usage since every article has categories.
* Will be updated as new categories emerge

> Wikipedia is a compendium of the world's knowledge. If you know what you are looking for, type it into Wikipedia's search box. If, however, you need a bird's eye view of what Wikipedia has to offer, see its main contents pages below, which in turn list more specific pages.


## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories

> Categories (along with other features like cross-references, lists, and infoboxes) help you to find information, even if you don't know what exists or what it's called. The following list of categories of Wikipedia's coverage parallels our other lists by topic.

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization

>The central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to Wikipedia pages in a hierarchy of categories which readers, knowing essential—defining—characteristics of a topic, can browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics.
>
>Categories are not the only means of enabling users to browse sets of related pages. Other tools which may be used instead of or alongside categories in particular instances include lists and navigation boxes. For a comparison of these techniques, see Categories, lists and navigation templates.

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Main_topic_articles

> This category contains the 40 articles that correspond to one of Wikipedia's major topic classifications. The major topic classifications are used throughout Wikipedia to organize the presentation of links to articles in Wikipedia.

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Main_topic_classifications

> This is a list of Wikipedia's major topic classifications. They are used throughout Wikipedia to organize the presentation of links to articles in its various reference systems, including Wikipedia's overviews, outlines, glossaries, lists, portals, indices, and categories. NOTE: The purpose of this category is to group major topic classifications in one place, for greater ease and for reference of users and editors of Wikipedia. This category is not intended to adhere to some strictly hierarchical structure.
