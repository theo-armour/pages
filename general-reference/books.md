>it let you register the books you’ve read, you own, you’re currently reading and want to read (TBR), it gives you personalised recommendations while giving you stats about your reading history. The books fall into categories which makes them easier to find: not only their genre but also their moods. You can also start a reading group with live reactions to certain parts of the story while avoiding spoilers!
>
>It has a ton of other cool features too:
>
>* Custom tags & Lists: organize, search and filter books by your tags;
>* Content Warnings: always check for possible triggering content;
>* Half & Quarter star reviews: be honest with your reviews! No need to round up!;
>* Reading journal: document your reading journey in an intimate and safe environment. Only visible to you!;
>* Up Next Queue: what do you want to read next?
>Not only it is a black-owned business, but it’s Amazon-free as well! It does offer a premium subscription, but it doesn’t really interfere with your experience on it. I’ve been using the free version and, honestly, it works great! Also, if you had a Goodreads account, no need to worry about losing your data since it can be directly transferred onto The Storygraph.
