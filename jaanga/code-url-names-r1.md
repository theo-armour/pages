### FAQ

#### _This convention is about URLs. Why should URL names affect the naming of folders and files on your own local computer?_

The days when files and folders only appeared on your computer are long gone.
Increasingly files are shared over networks and stored in the cloud.
When that happens folder and file names become part of a URL.
It then becomes good practice to assume that all your files will eventually be part of a URL.

#### _Why all lower case?_

From time to time is is necessary or expedient to edit a URL using your keyboard and typing characters.
If you know the URL is all lower case this can speed things up and reduce errors.

Another very good reason is that some operating systems differentiate between the case of folder and file names - and others do not.
If you stick to lower case you may simplify the process of moving files from one OS to another OS.
