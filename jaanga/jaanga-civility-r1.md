_Being nice to people encourages them to build good things_

## Introduction

This section is about improving the dialog between software producers and users by using techniques adapted from other endeavours.


### If You Write SoftWare

Writing free open source software ( [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) )can be harder than writing proprietary software.
Very often with proprietary software there is a salary or some form of renumeration attached to the writing.
Many FOSS projects also have salaried professionals involved, but the great majority of FOSS apps are written by people who receive no money in return.
The only reward for such work is the approbation of the community.

If you are contributing to a well-known, existing project and have a history of successful commits then approval and good wishes come fairly easily
Let us say, however, that you are working on a brand new product and you are the only team member.
You have come up with the concept and have started to implement some of the aspects.
Since the project is yours, it is highly meaningful to you and many of its aspects resonate with you.
You are putting in your best efforts and attempting to raise the bar with your work.
All of this could go without saying. After all you have chosen the project because it was the closest and most meaningful project you can do at the moment.

Are you emotionally engaged with this work? Of course you are.

Therefore you must be careful about the people your share your ideas.
This is not because they will steal your ideas. Nobody is into the project as you.
The chances are that they will not get what you are trying to do.
And in the process of not understanding, they will invalidate your efforts and take your energy down.

You have this amazing demo and the support docs say 'built and test on Chrome only'
Your friend sends you  message 'It's broken on FireFox'

You are creating a data viz of markets that does things never seen before.
Your friend says 'how do I make money with it?'

You created a vector app that makes wonderful vector drawings.
Your friend says 'Have you thought about creating bitmaps?'

None of the comments were derogatory in anyway about what you are actually doing.
Yet they very much missed the mark that you thought your were heading for.

Now you didn't show just anybody your app. You went to somebody you know and trusted.
And they still missed the mark/ They still did not get it.

So how do you feel now? The likelihood is that you feel quite tormented. You know what you are doing is useful, valuable and ingenious.
Yet your friend saw none of this. There's a conflict here and it will be hard for you to get over it.

As of this writing, we have no easy answer to this dilemma.

Actually we do have the answers - they are given in the sections below - but few peeps seem to get it.

[So it goes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_It_Goes ).

### If You Are A Mentor

What are the issues or problems this app is trying to solve?

What are the Goals of the project?

How close or far is this release from resolving the problem?

Are there choices in the algorithms that could be used. If so what are some of the trade offs. How does this release make best use of the technology/

Where could all this eventually lead to?



## Google's Research on What Makes Teams Productive

On Nov. 17, 2015, Google posted a story about internal research on identifying productive teams.
These findings relate well to the issues related to software developers and their advisers/mentors.

A summary of the elements of a good team:

1. Psychological safety:
	* Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
	* Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other
	* A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking
	* Most important of the five dynamics
	* Individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are less likely to leave Google, they’re more likely to harness the power of diverse ideas from their teammates, they bring in more revenue, and they’re rated as effective twice as often by executives.
2. Dependability:
	* Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
	* Team members get things done on time and meet Google's high bar for excellence
3. Structure & clarity:
	* Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
	* Team members have clear roles, plans and goals
4. Meaning of work:
	* Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
	* Work is personally important to team members
	* Roles, plans, and goals need to personally resonate with each of the members
5. Impact of work:
	* Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters?
	* Team members think that their work matters and creates change

## Code Reviews


[Effective Code Reviews]( http://blog.originate.com/blog/2014/09/29/effective-code-reviews/ )

> ### Be encouraging

> The purpose of code reviews is to build up, not to tear down. That goes for both the code and the team. If you see something that was done well, say so! For example, “I like the way you were able to refactor that giant for-loop into a couple of map and reduce calls! I’ll have to keep an eye out for that in my own code!”

> Everyone likes to receive positive feedback about their work. Plus, it will make you seem more appealing to work with, and it improves cohesiveness with the rest of the team.

> Also, try adding some emoji, or some funny gifs to lighten the mood.

> ### Adopt a positive attitude

> This is just as important for reviewers as well as submitters. Code reviews are not the time to get all alpha and exert your coding prowess. Nor do you need to get defensive. Go in to it with a positive attitude of constructive criticism and you can build trust around the process.

> The critique is a design school staple. You can find more than a few blog posts from design students about how “the crit” either made them as a designer, or broke their will to live. Substitute “critique” with “code review” and you’re likely to find just as many angst-filled blog posts in the open source community. Or, more likely, you’ll notice a lack of contributors following a particularly harsh text-based transaction.


## Improv

[The Tina Fey Method: 4 Ways Improvisation Can Improve Your Life]( http://www.levo.com/articles/lifestyle/how-improvisation-can-improve-your-life )

> Tina Fey has it all: a hit TV show, a bestselling book, a supportive family, respect as an awards host, and a flourishing career. How does she do it? She credits improvisation. In her book Bossypants, she discusses how the rules she learned at improv school Second City helped her succeed both on stage and off.

> As an actress, I struggle daily with confidence and insecurities. Improvising has helped me get out of my own head and access deeper parts of myself. In life, we are constantly editing ourselves and second-guessing our ideas in an attempt to be perfect. Improvisation dares us to trust our instincts and appreciate others and what they bring to the table. Implement these four basic improvisation rules into your everyday life and I guarantee you’ll see a difference.

> **1\. You must agree.** This doesn’t mean everyone has to get along, but it means you must agree on the given set of circumstances. For instance, if I say, “Wow, it’s great to be on the beach!” and you say, “We aren’t on the beach stupid, we are on the ski slope,” then the improv scene is dead. But if you say, “I can’t wait to get in the
water, I hope it’s not too cold,” then we have a scene. We have agreed that this stage is now a sandy beach and we can keep moving forward.

> I don’t recommend you agree with everyone in your life, but I challenge you to come from a place of “yes” and keep an open mind. Try to understand where others are coming from before discrediting them as “crazy” or “stupid.” “No” should be a last resort, and respect what others create.

> **2\. “Yes” isn’t enough, you must “yes, and…” Add to the discussion.** In the example above, the second person did not just say, “Yes we’re at the beach,” she said, “I can’t wait to get in the water, I hope it’s not too cold.” This statement adds value to the scene. Now the audience knows it’s cold and that we plan to enjoy the ocean as opposed to looking for gold or taking a yoga class.

> To me, this rule challenges you to contribute. Whether you are developing an ad campaign or deciding where to eat dinner, put your neck out there, give your thoughts and have a say. Two minds are always better than one.

> **3\. Make statements.** Have confidence. When you say something, mean it and stand behind it. How convincing would this proposal be in an improv scene: “I love you? I want you to marry me? I think I want to spend the rest of my life with you?” Let’s just say if he said that to me, he would not be putting a ring on it!

> If you have something to say, don’t be apologetic, don’t be shy, don’t second-guess yourself, be confident.

> Because at the end of the day….

> **4\. There are no mistakes!** Some of the best improvisation scenes come from miscommunications. Audiences love seeing actors fight their way out of a confusing, messy scene. For instance, if an actor is clearly on a baseball field holding a bat and chewing tobacco, and the other actor says, “Stop spitting on my new hardwood floors, and what’s that in your hand?” the audience is instantly hooked to see how the “baseball player” will justify his behavior without breaking the scene.

[Tina Fey’s Rules For Improv…And the WorkPlace]( http://www.mycareertopia.com/tina-feys-rules-for-improv-and-the-workplace/ )

> “Theater Games are a process applicable to any field, discipline, or subject matter which creates a place where full participation, communication, and transformation can take place.” — Viola Spolin

> In business, it pays to have the qualities of an improvisationist. Respect. Create. Contribute. Adapt.


[Build Better Habits With an Improvisational Mindset]( http://lifehacker.com/build-better-habits-with-an-improvisational-mindset-1738351098 )

> Breaking out of your daily routines can be a powerful way to unlock great new ideas, both personally and professionally. Jazz musicians and improv comedians are often masters at this idea of breaking from routine and taking a novel approach.
