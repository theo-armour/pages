## Aspirational Design

And it all started with a fake, pretend "aspirational" press release, said Mike George, vice president of Amazon Echo, at the Churchill Club annual award ceremony when accepting its "Magical Team" award last week.

When someone comes up with a possible product idea, Amazon honchos ask themselves, "Can this be fundamentally important to our customers? Can it be game-changing? Can we do it?" he described.

And then they try to think big, he explained:

"We have a thing called 'working backwards.' The first thing we do is we write a press release, ignoring every technical thing we can’t do for now. It’s our aspirations. We also write FAQs where we identify every question we would receive as if we issued the press release. We answer the question in aspirational ways too, ignoring, for the moment, the technical hurdles. In some cases we actually build things."

The idea is to dream about what this product could be.
