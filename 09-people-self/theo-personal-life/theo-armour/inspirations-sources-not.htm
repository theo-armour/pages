TA 2021 / Inspirations & Sources
Responding to questions is easier when you have good templates to build upon.

Below are texts & sources that I look to for inspiration as I tackle projects.

2021-05-19 ~ May be better as a series of small files
2021-05-18 ~ There is a fair amount of more stuff that may be added here.
Basic Idea
https://www.salon.com/2021/06/15/why-our-wandering-brains-are-wired-to-love-art-and-nature/

But here is the takeaway: we are not biologically programmed to like or this or that object, but rather inclined to
enjoy the process of play, improvisation, trial, and error in all things. In other words, recent research into mind
wandering and fractals suggests that the process of creativity and unconscious play involved in making and experiencing
art is a crucial source of aesthetic beauty and our love of nature.

“Yes” isn’t enough, you must “yes, and…”

Theo: I am an atheist. I strip out all the god stuff here and keep the rest

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship,
thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior.
Amen."

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
https://sdgs.un.org/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared
blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing -
in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies
that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and
working to preserve our oceans and forests.

Peter Drucker Quotes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker#Key_ideas

https://succeedfeed.com/peter-drucker-quotes/

That business purpose and business mission are so rarely given adequate thought is
perhaps the most important cause of business frustration and failure.
What gets measured gets improved
You can’t manage what you don’t measure.
There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.
Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right
if you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.
Teddy Roosevelt
“This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place
for all of us to live in.”

Serenity Prayer ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

Happiness, Hedonism
Much of my behavior is determined by desires to increase pleasure and to decrease pain. I am a regular hedonist.

At the same time, I feel the need for meaning, purpose and being useful.

Meaning of Life
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life

Finding meaning in life is a very tricky thing indeed, Fortunately and similarly to confirmation, analysis and bar
mitzvah - you can skip the whole thing and still have a perfectly decent life while completely ignoring the topic. Of
course if you do a double-click into finding meaning, you will find “it’s turtles all the way down.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down

For me it’s doing nice things - things that are simultaneously nice for me and good for the world.

Simple Living
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Simple_living
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downshifting_(lifestyle)
https://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/
There’s a lot to be said for Diogenes, Gandhi and Thoreau. They espoused a simple life. They are not alone. Promoting
aspects of the possibility of a simple lifestyle at the Heritage might serve as a market differentiator with competing
institutions that tend to promote a replete lifestyle.

A rationale for becoming a resident at the HotM is that it may enable a lifestyle that is much simpler with little loss
of benefits. It may enable a downshift lifestyle that increases pleasure.

Problems & Patterns
The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's et al A Pattern Language - as summarized on
page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the
solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the
same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the
problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Burning Man > The 10 Principles of Burning Man
Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey wrote the 10 Principles in 2004 as guidelines for the newly-formed Regional Network.
They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and
culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception.

Effective Altruism or Radical Philanthropy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism

Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that advocates using evidence and reasoning to determine the most
effective ways to benefit others. Altruism refers to improving the lives of others—as opposed to egoism, which
emphasizes only self-interest. Effectiveness refers to doing the most good with whatever resources are available—as
opposed to only doing some amount of good—as well as determining what is the most good by using evidence and
reasoning—as opposed to only doing what feels good or appears intuitively appealing.

“Standing on the shoulders of giants”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants

“Poor artists copy. Great artists steal.”

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements
already written.

The SDGs are such. And given that they offer a vision for the entire world in 2030 it behooves us to know about them and
take them to heart.

Follow Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars
A fundamental aspect of this project is to follow the Wikipedia Core Content Policies

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies

Neutral point of view – All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of
view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.
Verifiability – Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable,
published source. In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that
information comes from a reliable source.
No original research – Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a
reliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to
advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.
Wherever possible, the goals will link to reports, studies, laws, codes or whatever that support the premise at hand. It
is intended that the work be evidence-based rather than thoughts off the top of people’s head.

Fixing it may break it
Fixing something that is old does not make it new. If you do want something contemporary and futurable you may need to
take the old bits and reimagine them into an entirely new thing.

Looking back at the way things were done in the past may not always help you create a good vision for the future.
