* https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-standing-desk/

>No matter how great your office chair is, sitting in it all day isn’t doing your body any favors. But being on your feet constantly isn’t good for your comfort or health, either. An electric, height-adjustable standing desk gives you the best of both worlds. Want a productivity and energy boost? Push a button to raise the desk so you can move a little while working. Feel like leaning back in your chair for some deep focus time? Push another button to lower the desk. After reevaluating our top picks and testing three new models, we’ve reconfirmed that the Uplift V2 is the best standing desk for most people. It accommodates a wide range of heights, it’s stable at even its tallest setting, and it features a greater variety of attractive customization options than you’ll find on any competitor.
