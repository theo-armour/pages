# Soap

My favorite soap is _savon de Marseille_. It's made using olive oil. It usually doesn't smell much. But my favorite feature is that it lasts so long. It doesn't melt away in a week or so as do many bars of soap. This is because it is a very hard soap. Nonetheless it's still lathers quite well. And you get a squeaky clean feeling after washing your hands.

For several years the soap in my bathroom basin has been coming out of a liquid soap dispenser. Unfortunately during the pandemic I was not able to purchase any liquid soap. But I had several bars of commercial dial soap in my closet. So I started using these again. but I really hated the way it seemed to melt after a few uses. it was then I discovered the secret to making soap last longer. Turn the bar of soap over after each use. In other words, always put the wetter side up. This allows the soap to dry out. Which means the soap doesn't melt half as fast.
