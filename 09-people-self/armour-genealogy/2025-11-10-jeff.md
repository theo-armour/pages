I see you got in yesterday using your logon, and you have full editing rights, I believe.

I am also sending you an email with tips and tricks, And helping you figure out how Geni and MyHeritage are joined at the hip.

Cheers,

Theo

First steps

Hi Jeff

See also WhatsApp message with Geni Login and my tips email.

I think your first mission is just to learn about using the green tree icon. I've gone back through the Russian side to a Doge of Venice in the 800s

The second mission might be to look for any notable people going back to, say, 1800, not in the list I sent you a while back.

The third mission would be to learn about how to confirm references between Geni and MyHeritage. Perhaps a good place to start might be with the references to my parents, Norman Armour Jr and Cynthia Sewall Burrage,
