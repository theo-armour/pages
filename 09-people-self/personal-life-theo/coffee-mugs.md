Why the Simple Modern coffee thing is good:

* It fits in a Keurig machine.
* The screw top screws on easily.
* It's really easy to clean.
* It fits in a cup holder.
* I can clean the bottom of it ~ I can clean the whole thing all the way down to the bottom.
* The outside is an interesting pattern, not just a color, and good choices are available.
* It's unbreakable.
* The top is clear plastic and not black plastic that may have heavy metals in it
* It's quite spill proof

So far, it's the best travel coffee mug that I've had. It's also very easy to clean, and so far it's been quite spill-proof. I can turn it upside down with water in it, and have nothing coming out. I'm going to test and see how it does with coffee.
