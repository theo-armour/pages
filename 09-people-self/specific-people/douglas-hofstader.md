### Gödel, Escher, Bach, and AI

A dazzlingly fast chatbot cannot replace the authentic and reflective voice of a thinking, living human being.

By Douglas Hofstadter

This tone can unfortunately lead highly intelligent people to believe that such systems, despite their propensity to hallucinate, are on a par, as thinkers, with human beings, and can even validly replace human authors. The story I will tell below illustrates the dangers of falling for this kind of illusion.

I frankly am baffled by the allure, for so many unquestionably insightful people (including many friends of mine), of letting opaque computational systems perform intellectual tasks for them. Of course it makes sense to let a computer do obviously mechanical tasks, such as computations, but
when it comes to using language in a sensitive manner and talking about real-life situations where the distinction between truth and falsity and between genuineness and fakeness is absolutely crucial, to me it makes no sense whatsoever to let the artificial voice of a chatbot, chatting randomly away at dazzling speed, replace the far slower but authentic and reflective voice of a thinking, living human being.

To fall for the illusion that computational systems “who” have never had a single experience in the real world outside of text are nevertheless perfectly reliable authorities about the world at large is a deep mistake, and, if that mistake is repeated sufficiently often and comes to be widely accepted, it will undermine the very nature of truth on which our society—and I mean all of human society—is based.

My thoughts

DH's argument is valid when talking about literature, but may not be so right when the issue is to find a solution to a problem, and the solution is to find a solution to a problem, or to write a program.

Just because AI may fail in one area or in one task, it does not mean it will fail in all areas and in all tasks.
