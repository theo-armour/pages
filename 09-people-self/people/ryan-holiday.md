The Book in Three Sentences
* What stands in the way becomes the way.
* Focus on the things you can control, let go of everything else and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, and tougher.
* It’s three interdependent, interconnected, and fluidly contingent disciplines: Perception, Action, and the Will.




# _The Obstacle is the Way_

_the following is the start of a summary of Holiday's book_

In _The Obstacle is the Way_, Holiday divides stoic thinking into: perception, action and will


* Perception - how we look at our specific problems - attitude - approach p6
	* See the truth - which is neither good nor bad
* Actions - how we turn problems into opportunities
* Will - handle defeat and difficulty


# Perception



Examine your impressions

* 'Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?'
Remind yourself of the impermanence of things
* In the case of particular things that delight you, or benefit you, or to which you have grown attached, remind yourself of what they are. Start with things of little value. If it is china you like, for instance, say, ‘I am fond of a piece of china.’ When it breaks, then you won’t be as disconcerted. When giving your wife or child a kiss, repeat to yourself, ‘I am kissing a mortal.’ Then you won’t be so distraught if they are taken from you. (Enchiridion III)
Reserve clause
* Whenever planning an action, mentally rehearse what the plan entails, fate permitting.
How can I use virtue here and now?
* use every occasion, every challenge, as a way to exercise our virtue, to become a better human being by constant practice.


To see things as they truly are - neither good nor bad.
To see the opportunity within the obstacle
To see disaster rationally
Results from self-discipline and logic

Desperation, fear, powerlessness: functions of our perceptions
Outward appearance: deceptive


We must try / we have choice:

* To be objective / p30 - disciplined
* To control emotions and keep an even keel / p27
* To choose to see the good in a situation / p53
* To steady our nerves / p24
* To ignore what disturbs or limits others / 48
* To place things in perspective / p36
* To revert to the present moment / 45
* To focus on what can be controlled / p38


### Recognize Your Power

I decide how things affect me. Choose not to be harmed.

It's your decision.

You control your thoughts, beliefs and reactions.

There is the event and there are your thoughts about what the event means.

A mistake becomes training.



### Steady Your Nerves p24

Grace and poise.

Tranquil courage. Serenity of soul. Cool head.

Nerve is a matter of defiance and control - and acceptance.

prepare for the realities. Steel yourself

Behave as if nothing had happened. If your nerves hold, then nothing really did 'happen'

***

Be water?



### Control Your Emotions p27

The art of not panicking.

I am in control, not my emotions, I see what is really going on. I am not going to get excited or upset.



### Practice Objectivity p30 / To be Objective

The difference between observing and perceiving. The previous eye is weak. the observing eye is strong
the observing sees simply what is there. The perceiving eye sees more than what is there

The observing sees events, clear of distractions, exaggerations and misperceptions.
The perceiving eys 'insurmountable obstacles' or 'major setbacks' or even just 'issues'.

Nietsche: sometimes being superficial - taking things only at first glance - is the most profound approach

The aim is to see things as they really are, without any of the ornamentation

Marcus Aurelius:

> roasted meat is a dead animal
> vintage wine is old fermented grapes

Remove 'you' from the equation. Pretend it's not happening to you.

Give yourself clarity, not sympathy.


### To place things in Perspective / Alter Perspective / p36

Remember: We choose how we’ll look at things.

**Context** - a sense of the larger picture - not just what is immediately in front of us
**Framing** - individual's unique way of looking at the world, a way that interprets it events

We choose how we look at things. We retain the ability to inject perspective into a situation.

Perception precedes action. Right action follows right perspective.


### To focus on what can be controlled / Is it Up to You / p384

What is up to us. What is not up to us.

What is up to us:

* Our judgments
* Our creativity
* Our attitude
* Our perspective
* Our desires
* Our decisions
* Our determination

What is not up to us
What we cannot control

The weather
The economy
disasters
Other people's emotions



## To revert to the present moment / Live in the Moment / p42

Obstacles exist in the past and the future. There are no obstacles in the present.



### To ignore what disturbs or limits others / Think Differently / p49

Be open. Question.

Make something where there was nothing before.


### To choose to see the good in a situation / Find the Opportunity / p52

There is good in everything, if only we look for it.

Beyond an immediate negative reaction is opportunity

No glass-half-full platitudes. There must be complete flip. Seeing through negative and into its corollary: the positive

# Part II Action

p60 Problems are rarely as bad as we think. Rather they are precisely as bad as we think.

Our actions must be:
* Deliberate
* Bold
* Persistent

We greet our obstacles with:

with energy p70
with persistence
with coherent and deliberate process
with iteration and resilience
with pragmatism
with strategic vision
with craftiness and savvy
with an eye for opportunity and pivotal moments




### energy / Get Moving / p70


The importance of aggression, taking risks, of barreling forward.

Stay moving. Always

courage is mostly just taking action,

All the greats started by saying: Yes. Let's go.


### persistence / Practice Persistence / p74

Working at it works

In trying all the wrong ways, you my discover a new way

Unity of purpose, deafness to doubt and the desire to stay at it

Consider this mind=set:

* Never in a hurry
* Never worried
* Never desperate
* Never stopping short

It's supposed to be hard



## Iterate / p81

Failure is a feature

Action and failure are two sides of the same coin

The world is telling you something with each failure. Listen.

Failure shows us the way - by showing us what isn't the way.

## Follow the Process / p85

Do what you need to do right now.

The process is order. keep our perceptions in check, our actions in sync.


The process is about doing the right thing right now



## Do Your Job, Do it Right / p90

Everything is a chance to do and be your best.

When action is our priority, vanity falls away.

Our job

* hard work
* honesty
* helping others as best we can


## What’s Right is What Works / p98


Pragmatism

Think progress not perfection

## In Praise of the Flank Attack / p100

Take a step back, then go around the problem. Find some leverage. Approach fron the 'line of leat resistence'


## Use Obstacles Against Themselves


## Channel Your Energy


## Seize The Offensive


## Prepare for None of It to Work
