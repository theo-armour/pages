> In City Life, Witold Rybczynski, bestselling author of Now I Sit Me Down, looks at what we want from cities, how they have evolved, and what accounts for their unique identities. In this vivid description of everything from the early colonial settlements to the advent of the skyscraper to the changes wrought by the automobile, the telephone, the airplane, and telecommuting, Rybczynski reveals how our urban spaces have been shaped by the landscapes and lifestyles of the New World.

* A litany of facts laced with cryptic personal opinions
* Provides nowhere near the wisdom of the writers he invokes
* A collection of chapters with minimal connections between them

Observqtions
* Dislikes Corb's works - particularly _la Ville Radieuse_ - but loves their American descendants: the malls and tower blocks everywhere
* Tells you some things are distasteful but does noy explain why
* Lists what happens - Laws of the Indies, street grids ~ but provides little background on the whys and both positive and negative outcomes
* Seems to live Paris but vague as to why he loves Paris
* Praises the American mall that is replacing the decrepit downtown - it appears because mostly in a privately owned mall  you are able to keep dirty and bad people out!
* Invokes Jacobs, Lynch, Mumford and other as names but provides no background on their importance and relevance
* Little comparing and contrasting with non-American patterns. For example: street patterns that follow contours may provide a very different urban experience than grids do in cities with steep hills.
* Where are the pictures and diagrams?
* Why are the notes footnoted in the source pages
