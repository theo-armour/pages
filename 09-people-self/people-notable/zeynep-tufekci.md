>Zeynep Tufekci is a Turkish sociologist and writer. Her work focuses on the social implications of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data, as well as societal challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic using complex and systems-based thinking. She has been described as “having a habit on being right on the big things” by The New York Times and as one of the most prominent academic voices on social media by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

>She is currently a writer for the Times and The Atlantic and has written regular columns for Wired and Scientific American in the past. She is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina and a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.

>Originally from Turkey, Ms. Tufekci was a computer programmer by profession and academic training before turning her focus to the impact of technology on society and social change. She switched to social science, and started calling herself a “technosociologist.” She has been published widely on the interaction of new technologies with society, politics and culture. Her forthcoming book from Yale University Press is tentatively titled “Beautiful Tear Gas: The Ecstatic, Fragile Politics of Networked Protest in the 21st Century.”

>About Insight
>Insight is a newsletter for people interested in thinking deeply about the world’s hardest, most complex and vital puzzles. It’s about the interaction between technology and society, the impacts of the transitions flowing through the globe but also about the pandemic that’s transforming the world.
>
>Insight is a place for complicated, in-depth discussions that don’t constantly hedge and hem-and-haw defensively but also don’t undersell the uncertainty. Discussions that are practical in their orientation but honest in acknowledging ambiguity and unknowns about the world’s massive challenges. Discussions that treat the reader as a partner in thinking.

## Article

* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-airborne-transmission.html

Zeynep Tufekci has written a very good article on the research, findings, and outcomes carried out by the CDC and WHO on the handling the Covid-19 virus.

She argues clearly, forcefully and logically the missteps taken by the two organizations. The guidance provided hampered effectiveness by wasting resources on efforts that served no good purpose. In describing issues with mental models, she provides insights you can use here and elsewhere. She describes actions that these organizations should take.

The article contains links to authoritative sources. It's not a difficult read and more over provides a number of historical situations that make the story understandable.


>Another dynamic we’ve seen is something that is not unheard-of in the history of science: setting a higher standard of proof for theories that challenge conventional wisdom than for those that support it.

>Another key problem is that, understandably, we find it harder to walk things back. It is easier to keep adding exceptions and justifications to a belief than to admit that a challenger has a better explanation.

>So much of what we have done throughout the pandemic — the excessive hygiene theater and the failure to integrate ventilation and filters into our basic advice — has greatly hampered our response.


## Aerosols, Droplets

droplets aerosols difference

### Definitions

### micron or Micrometre

Alternative Titles: μm, micron. Micrometre, also called micron, metric unit of measure for length equal to 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch.

### Nanometer

Micrometer A micrometer (also called a micron) is 1000 times smaller than a millimeter. ... Nanometer A nanometer is 1000 times smaller than a micrometer. 1 micrometer (μm) = 1000 nanometers.

Uranium atom has a diameter of 0.14 nanometers

hydrogen atom is about 0.1 nanometers, and a caesium atom is around 0.3nm. The atoms used in silicon chip fabrication are around 0.2 nm

The diameter of an atom ranges from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers (1 × 10−10 m to 5 × 10−10 m)

### C-19

It has a round or elliptic and often pleomorphic form and a diameter of approximately 60–140 nm.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/

### Aerosol

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol

The liquid or solid particles have diameters typically less than 1 μm or 1,000 nm;


### Droplet

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_droplet

Large droplets: > 5 µm

Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5 μm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 m

large” droplets, “small” droplets and droplet nuclei being >60 μm in diameter, ≤60 μm in diameter and <10 μm in diameter, respectively

## Fomite

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite
>A fomite (/ˈfoʊmaɪt/) or fomes (/ˈfoʊmiːz/) is any inanimate object that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents (such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses or fungi), can transfer disease to a new host. In the 21st century, the role of fomites in disease transfer is higher than ever in human history because of the indoor lifestyle.

## Vector

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)

In epidemiology, a disease vector is any agent which carries and transmits an infectious pathogen into another living organism; agents regarded as vectors are organisms, such as intermediate parasites or microbes. The first major discovery of a disease vector came from Ronald Ross in 1897, who discovered the malaria pathogen when he dissected a mosquito.

### airborne transmission

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_transmission

An airborne transmission is disease transmission through small particulates that can be transmitted through the air over time and distance.[2] Diseases capable of airborne transmission include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, flushing toilets, or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles.
