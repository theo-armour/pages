> No mention of music.
> No mention of writing.

## Chapter 10: The Point of Exploration.

Explore, then exploit. The more people explore, the better choices they make. The more people date, the better the marriage stability.

Distance matters

Frequency breeds Familiarity breeds favorability.

The power of familiarity, and certainly almost Doom's psychological witness. Sticking to routines feels better.

We need to overcome familiarity by our bias in order to explore the new and unknown.

### The many benefits of exploration!

Multicultural experience is associated with creativity.

## Chapter 11: Turn Adversity into a Psychologically Rich Experience

Most psychologically rich experiences are intentional.

The best of humanity often comes out from the worst of conditions.

Kahneman Says he had an interesting life. Not necessarily happy or meaningful.

Time does not always heal everything.

Psychological richness and misfortune can co-exist so long as the misfortune is kept in check.

## Chapter 12: A Story We Tell

Can we make a life sound like a psychologically richer one? Cheat coe??

Edit your story to make it more psychologically rich.

p145 By seeing our old selves as not particularly self-confident, socially skilled, or independent, we can see our current selves as much stronger in those areas.

p149 To begin here, please describe very briefly what the main chapters in the book might be. What does a table of contents for your book look like? How many chapters are there in your book? How would you name each chapter?”

### p160 Finding richness in the familiar.

Søren Kierkegaard’s 1843 Either/Or is all about the conflicts between stability and instability, boredom and excitement, long term and short term, rationality and passion, planning and spontaneity.

## Chapter 13: Two Remaining Questions Too Much Rich

p154 Can a life be too psychologically rich?

p154 Can we also gain psychological richness by staying, or from familiar objects and people?

p155 excessive childhood moves could have a lingering negative effect on subjective well-being in adulthood among introverts because they tend to have a harder time making social connections in new places and end up with few close relationships in adulthood.

## Chapter Fourteen: A Good Life Without Regrets

p178 Like Goldmund in Narcissus and Goldmund, even if you aren’t happy and don’t find your life to be meaningful, you can still lead a good life if you fill it with diverse, interesting, and perspective-changing experiences.

Finished. At last! Zero counterfactuals. Is that the problem with it?
AI> That there are no surprises? No unexpected twists? No counterintuitive findings? Just a litany of examples that prove the same point over and over again?

Okay, happiness and meaning are sort of counterfactuals. But they all fit in with the triad of three dimensions.

Having said that, I'm glad I read it! It makes me happy and gives meaning to my life. ;-) Which has been rich in so many ways.

More of the same. A litany of examples that prove this point. At least I'm taking notes! And because I have not copy-pasted so much, I can copy-paste text from the book.Fingers crossed I don't run out of copy-pastes in Amazon Kindle!

One nice thing is that this book is easier to summarize than Agnes's book. I should read a bit more about Kahneman. Seems an interesting person. Perhaps even psychologically rich.

Halfway through. Up to Chapter 10. It's a very nice, pleasant, happy and meaningful book, but frankly I don't find it to be very psychologically rich. Most everything he says is quite predictable. I agree with what he says. I agree with his findings. All the studies he references agree with him. The writing is a quick read, the writing is clear, and everything follows logically.But none of that actually makes it interesting.

AI>I was hoping for more surprises, more unexpected twists, more counterintuitive findings. But no, it's all quite straightforward. I guess that's the problem with psychology these days. It's all about finding what makes people happy and meaningful, and then telling them to do that. There's not much room for complexity or nuance anymore.
