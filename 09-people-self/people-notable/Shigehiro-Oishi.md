Complexity and unexpectedness enhance visual and perceptual richness.

Transcending experiences different from our typical everyday experiences produce a different set of thoughts and emotions. In short, psychologically rich experiences.

## Chapter 10: The Point of Exploration.

Explore, then exploit. The more people explore, the better choices they make. The more people date, the better the marriage stability.

Distance matters

Frequency breeds Familiarity breeds favorability.

The power of familiarity, and certainly almost Doom's psychological witness. Sticking to routines feels better.

We need to overcome familiarity by our bias in order to explore the new and unknown.

### The many benefits of exploration!

Multicultural experience is associated with creativity.

## Chapter 11: Turn Adversity into a Psychologically Rich Experience

Most psychologically rich experiences are intentional.

Halfway through. Up to Chapter 10. It's a very nice, pleasant, happy and meaningful book, but frankly I don't find it to be very psychologically rich. Most everything he says is quite predictable. I agree with what he says. I agree with his findings. All the studies he references agree with him. The writing is a quick read, the writing is clear, and everything follows logically.But none of that actually makes it interesting.

AI>I was hoping for more surprises, more unexpected twists, more counterintuitive findings. But no, it's all quite straightforward. I guess that's the problem with psychology these days. It's all about finding what makes people happy and meaningful, and then telling them to do that. There's not much room for complexity or nuance anymore.
