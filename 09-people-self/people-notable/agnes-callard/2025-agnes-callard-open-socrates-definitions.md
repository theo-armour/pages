Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyian strategy. p4

The name for the opposite strategy is "Socratic". p4

Fifteen-minutes of fame is a phrase that was coined by Andy Warhol in 1968. It refers to the idea that fame can be fleeting and that someone can become famous for a brief period of time.

## Politics


## Politicization

Politicization is the displacement of a disagreement from the context of argumentation into a 0 sum context where if one party wins, the other party loses. It converts a question, which is of two positions is correct â€” into a competition between the interests of two parties. 

Politicization is a pathology of politics. A mapping of a disagreement into a contest. p255

## Practice of Equality


## Savage Commands

**savage commands** Contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act confused in haphazard ways. p19

## Socrates Character

Socrates presented himself as one can become, as a kind of person, someone imitatable enough to have his persona replicated." p8

Socrates made himself into someone that other people could be. p7

Socrates understands that his wisdom is worthless. p8

Socrates thought that anyone could become a Socrates. p8

Because Socrates understands that he is not wise, he is pleased to be shown to be wrong. p10


## Socratizing Move


The practice of Socratic ignorance is a kind of mastery of the deepest things. The mechanism of this reversal is something that I call the Socratic move. p246

You Socratize something when you show that it must be understood in the light of something else. Something of which it is the imitation. p246

One facet of Socratizing is that it moves upward rather than downward. p246

Socrates unified domains as a as distinct as love, death, and politics, not by analyzing them in terms of some underlying common denominator, but rather by seeing them as converging upward toward a single aspiration. Inquiry into untimely questions. p248

Instead of arguing that these domains all have a common source or cause, or built upon outer common materials, Socrates argues that what they have in common is a goal. p248

Anti Socratizing unifies by way of a common material cause. Where Socrates in unifies by a common final 'cause. p248

Virtue is to be found first and foremost inside of philosophical conversation. p249

Real courage and moderation and piety and justice are manifested in speech and more specifically in the back and forth of inquisitive reputation. p249

Socrates is making the radical claim that for ignorant people like us, human goodness is primarily expressed in how a person conducts herself in inquiry, and that conversation is where we find our true home. p249

## Tolstoy Problem

Tolstoy's crisis was caused by his inability to answer certain questions. p3

He cannot understand why he cares about any of those things. p3

I would say to myself, "Why?" p4

## Untimely questions

Untimely questions are marked by the fact that we need answers to them before we are prepared to answer them. p19
