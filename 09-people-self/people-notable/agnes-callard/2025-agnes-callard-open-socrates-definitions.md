Questions that come too late. p26

If you keep tracking one 15-minute period onto another, eventually it adds up to a life. p2

Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyan strategy; the name for the opposite strategy is Socratic. p5

The last thing I want to do is embark upon an exhausting existential enquiry. p26

We learn to take life 15 minutes at a time. If you add up enough of those 15-minute periods, the sum total is a whole life.

We find a way to avoid ever asking, "What will come of my whole life?" p26

We will find it replete with reasons for postponing philosophical inquiry. p26

Death will rescue us from ever having to come to terms with the meaninglessness of life. p26

Protagoras thinks he must turn his attention elsewhere, away from inquiry. He needs to get on with the next 15 minutes of his life. p37

The only way to go through the next 15 minutes is to convince yourself that you're doing something much nobler than getting through the next 15 minutes. p43

If we never inquire into untimely questions, the thinking which we use to guide our lives will be unstable. We will never be able to rely on it for very long, perhaps no more than 15 minutes or so, before it is subject to being overturned. p44

Whereas the non-philosopher is always in a hurry when he is talking, he has to speak with one eye on the clock. The philosopher resists taking his life 15 minutes at a time. He talks in peace and quiet and his time is his own. He talks in peace and quiet and his time is his own. Socrates says that it does not matter to such people whether they talk for a day or a year, if only they may hit upon that which is. p47

If you can find your gaze, never looking back, never looking too far ahead, always only make it through the next 15 minutes, you can avoid being confronted with evidence of your wavering. p50

Both the bodily command and the kinesthetic command make us waver. They might give us a loud clear answer as to what we ought to do, but the answers don't last. By frequently reversing themselves, they prompt us to take life 15 minutes at a time. p87

You're saying that you have some kind of grip on how you should be acting. What's actually happening is that you're wavering because you can't keep the grip for more than 15 minutes at a time. You waver in how you act and then you waver in how you talk about how you didn't waver when you acted. You can't even stabilize your sentences for more than a few seconds  at a time. p93

The prospect of death represents the stopping of the clock that has been ticking in the background of everything we do, counting off each 15-minute period. p343

Socrates sketches a prototype of the ideal philosopher and contrasts it with someone who "is always in a hurry, when he is talking, he has to speak with one eye on the clock". Interlocutors such as Eurythipro and Protagoras routinely break off their conversation with Socrates by telling him that it is time for them to go, that they are getting through life 15 minutes at a time, which is to say they speak "with one eye on the clock". p365 

Projects that take longer than 15 minutes, be it months or years, also keep you on the clock, both because they typically dictate what you need to do for a given 15-minute period, and because they stand in the shadow of the big clock of life. p365

Even a project that requires you to dedicate your whole lifetime to it is different from the one that requires you to take your eye off the clock altogether. p365

Whereas we usually ask ourselves what we can get done in the next 15 minutes, or the next few years, or perhaps our whole lives, when we step into the role of philosopher we must disregard all such clocks. p365

Because that is the only way to ask questions such as, is the soul immortal? Or what is thinking? Or how can love be both rational and attached? Or when and where do we practice equality? p365

How do you take on in a life a project that is too big for life? p365

What if, like Socrates, you Have less than an hour to live and you've just been confronted with some objections that call for more than an hour's worth of philosophizing. How do you avoid giving up? p366

Socrates does not spend his final hours taking a last draft of his usual pleasure of philosophical conversations. He spends them looking for answers. 
By his own account, Tolstoy spends much of his first part of his life 15 minutes at a time, until sometime around mid-life. He looks up from the clock and finds himself faced with a set of untimely questions, only to be immediately engulfed by waves of FONA. p367

### Biblio

Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyian strategy. p4

The name for the opposite strategy is "Socratic". p4

Fifteen-minutes of fame is a phrase that was coined by Andy Warhol in 1968. It refers to the idea that fame can be fleeting and that someone can become famous for a brief period of time. The phrase has since become a popular way to describe the phenomenon of people becoming famous for a short period of time.

* Agnes is mostly always in the present. what about the past and future?


### Directions vs Maps

* https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/05/sycophantic-ai/682743/
>There’s a good analogy in maps. Traditional maps showed us an entire landscape—streets, landmarks, neighborhoods—allowing us to understand how everything fit together. Modern turn-by-turn navigation gives us precisely what we need in the moment, but at a cost: Years after moving to a new city, many people still don’t understand its geography. We move through a constructed reality, taking one direction at a time, never seeing the whole, never discovering alternate routes, and in some cases never getting the sense of place that a map-level understanding could provide. The result feels more fluid in the moment but ultimately more isolated, thinner, and sometimes less human.
* The directions are not the map is not the territory ;-)


## Political Fictions

* Freedom of Speech
* Egalitarianism
* Fight for Social Justice

## Politics


## Politicization

Politicization is the displacement of a disagreement from the context of argumentation into a 0 sum context where if one party wins, the other party loses. It converts a question, which is of two positions is correct — into a competition between the interests of two parties. 

Politicization is a pathology of politics. A mapping of a disagreement into a contest. p255

## Practice of Equality


## Savage Commands

**savage commands** Contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act confused in haphazard ways. p19

### Bodily Command

* Weakness of will

### Kinship Command

* Revenge


## Socrates Character

Socrates presented himself as one can become, as a kind of person, someone imitatable enough to have his persona replicated." p8

Socrates described his life project in feminine terms, saying that he is a kind of midwife to ideas. p6

Socrates made himself into someone that other people could be. p7

Socrates understands that his wisdom is worthless. p8

Socrates thought that anyone could become a Socrates. p8

Because Socrates understands that he is not wise, he is pleased to be shown to be wrong. p10


## Socratizing Move

The practice of Socratic ignorance is a kind of mastery of the deepest things. The mechanism of this reversal is something that I call the Socratic move. p246

You Socratize something when you show that it must be understood in the light of something else. Something of which it is the imitation. p246

One facet of Socratizing is that it moves upward rather than downward. p246

Socrates unified domains as a as distinct as love, death, and politics, not by analyzing them in terms of some underlying common denominator, but rather by seeing them as converging upward toward a single aspiration. Inquiry into untimely questions. p248

Instead of arguing that these domains all have a common source or cause, or built upon outer common materials, Socrates argues that what they have in common is a goal. p248

Anti Socratizing unifies by way of a common material cause. Where Socrates in unifies by a common final 'cause. p248

Virtue is to be found first and foremost inside of philosophical conversation. p249

Real courage and moderation and piety and justice are manifested in speech and more specifically in the back and forth of inquisitive reputation. p249

Socrates is making the radical claim that for ignorant people like us, human goodness is primarily expressed in how a person conducts herself in inquiry, and that conversation is where we find our true home. p249


## Tolstoy Problem

Tolstoy's crisis was caused by his inability to answer certain questions. p3

He cannot understand why he cares about any of those things. p3

I would say to myself, "Why?" p4

## Untimely questions

Untimely questions are marked by the fact that we need answers to them before we are prepared to answer them. p19

Our default answers, the ones available to us absent philosophizing, come from unreliable sources, our bodies and other people. These sources issue savage commands contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act in confused and haphazard ways. p19

An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time — namely after it has been answered. 

Untimely questions are remarkable not only because they are hard toAnswer. But first and foremost, because they are hard to ask. And they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to pose them to others, but first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself. p27

The reason why you can't ask yourself untimely questions is that because you think you already have the answer to them. And the reason you think you have the answer is that you are using the answer. p27

The difficulty is that we can't make use of the answer and ask ourselves the question at the same time. p29

You are not supposed to regard these questions as open, precisely because you are supposed to be already using the answers in the caring you are currently doing. p30

The answer is that he wasn't. He could say the words of the question to himself, but he couldn't ask them. p30
