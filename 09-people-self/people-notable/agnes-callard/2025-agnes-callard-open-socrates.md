# Open Socrates

* The Case for a Philosophical Life

## Introduction: The man whose name is an example ~ p1

Your life is full. It has no space for the question, "Why am I doing any of this?"

Necessities bypass the why question p1

Fifteen-minute periods p1

You make sure your thinking about how your life should go doesn't wander too far from how it is going already. p2

### I.Tolstoy p2 

Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910)

The Tolstoy Problem: "Why should I live?"

By his own lights, what Tolstoy discovered is that the examined life was not worth living. p4

Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyian strategy. p4

The name for the opposite strategy is "Socratic". p4

### II. Socrates p5

The philosopher Socrates found himself confronted with profound questions he did not know how to answer. And yet Socrates came to the conclusion that this confrontation was the best, not the worst, thing that ever happened to him. p6

Socrates presented himself as a person one can become, as a Kind of person, someone imitable enough to have his persona replicated in so many dialogs and plays. p7

a midwife to ideas p7

Socrates made himself into someone that other people could be. p7

For the Oracle of Delphi, Socrates is an example. p8

Socrates understands that his wisdom is worthless.  p8

Socrates thought that anyone could become a Socrates. p8

Because Socrates understands that he is not wise. He is pleased to be shown to be wrong, and that is the kind of person he also needs Gorgias to be. p10

I count being refuted a greater good, In so far as it is a greater good for oneself to be delivered from the worst thing there is than to deliver somewhat else from it. p10

Socrates predicted that after his death, the world would be filled with Socrateses. p11 

### III. Where Is Socratic Ethics

* Jeremy Benthem
* John Stuart Mill
* Henry Sidgewick

That is likely to result in as many benefits to as many beneficiaries as possible. p11

The benefits are typically understood in terms of the presence of pleasure. And the absence of pain. And the beneficiaries are typically assumed to be human beings. 

This theory is called utilitarianism. p12

Immanuel Kant (1724 -1804 )

A form of ethics that is focused on the ways that dignity — the infinite worth of every rational being — constrains how we are allowed to treat one another. 

This system features a "categorical imperative" or absolute prohibition against using a human being as a mere tool for the benefit of others.  p12

**utilitarianism**  << Epicureanism. 

Kant << Stoicism. p12

But

The action that best promotes the greatest good for the greatest number is not guaranteed to be the same, in all, cases as the action that shows respect for the dignity of another person. p13

Leads to the trolley problems

Savage Command: Save me. Or cooperate with us.  p13

**Neo-Aristotianism**

Someone who has been well habituated pursues happiness and pleasure by herself by means of behaving respectfully toward others, which is to say, she aims at virtue. p13

People will announce "question everything" without noticing that they have just uttered not a question but a command. 

The Socratic motto is not "question everything" but "persuade or be persuaded". p15 

### IV. An Incautionary Tale

The message is: Do philosophy, but don't overdo it.  p18

We live inside a bubble of caution and weariness that can only be sustained by maintaining the conviction that when it comes to the question of how we live our lives. We are already being intellectual and critical and thoughtful enough. The assumption is that no one, not even a professional academic philosopher, needs to be living their whole life in a philosophical manner. 

This book is an argument to the contrary. It makes the case for a philosophical life. p19


It has three parts. 

**Part 1** A special class of questions. Untimely questions. 

**Untimely questions** are marked by the fact that we need answers to them before we are prepared to answer them. p19

Our default answers, the ones available to us absent philosophizing - Come from unreliable sources. Our bodies and other people. p19

**savage commands** Contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act confused in haphazard ways. p19

* Utilitarianism aims to rehabilitate the bodily command. 
* Kantianism the command of the group. 
* Aristotelianism tries to harmonize the two commands with one another. p19

Socrates solution:  Give one person the task of asserting the truth and the other person the job of avoiding falsehoods. p20


**Part 2**: The Socratic approach to untimely questions. 

Each of its three parts. Inquiry, open mindedness and truth seeking. Conceals her paradox. p19

* Inquiry ~ How can one search for what one does not know? How can one recognize it when one finds it? 
* Open-mindedness ~ willing to admit that you are wrong. 
* Truth-Seeking ~ Pursuing the truth and avoiding falsity.  p20

**Part 3**: We examine that method's demands in the three areas of human life where Socrates thought our ignorance loomed largest. Politics, love and death. p20

Socratic ethics is the ethics of living a truly philosophical life. And it tells you that the way you should conduct yourself in each of these three domains is inquisitively. It promises to make people freer and more equal, more romantic and more courageous.  p20

Socrates says that vice is ignorance. That falling in love is an attempt to ascend to another plane of existence. And if he were around today, he would accuse all of us of treating corpses in a superstitious manner. 

He insists that everyone desires the good and that treating others unjustly is worse for the person who does so than being unjustly treated herself. In his hands, both freedom of speech and the egalitarianism become not political ideas but intellectual ones. He thinks that philosophy is a preparation for death. p21

We want to be the kind of person that the historical Socrates. No doubt imperfectly. Tried to make himself into. It is the same kind of person that played out again, no doubt imperfectly tried to copy. p21

"Why am I doing any of this?"

## Part One: Untimely Questions ~ p23

## Chapter 1: the Tolstoy Problem

What will come from what I do and from what I will do tomorrow? What will come from my whole life? p23

If most people find themselves unbothered by Tolstoy's question. Is it because they have a real answer to it, or because they have the power to ignore it? p26

### I. Questions that come too late

I want to do is. Embark upon an exhaustive existential inquiry. p26

We learned to take life 15 minutes at a time.  p26

We find a way of to avoid ever asking "what will come from my whole life?"

We will find it replete with reasons for postponing philosophical inquiry. p26

Death will rescue us from ever having to come to terms with a meaninglessness of life. p26

An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time — namely, after it has been answered. p26

Untimely questions are hard to answer, But first and foremost, because they are hard to ask. And they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to post them to others. But first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself. p27

You'll be going through the motions of inquiry without actually inquiring into anything. p27

The reason why you can't ask yourself untimely questions is that you think you already have the answer to them. And the reason you think you have the answer is that you are already using the answer. 

The difficulty is that we can't make use of the answer and ask ourselves a question at the same time. 

### II. What Tolstoy Couldn't Do

## Part Two: The Socratic Method

## Chapter 5: The Gadfly-Midwife Paradox

## Chapter 6: Moore's Paradox of Self Knowledge

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox
* The more fundamental manner of stating the problem starts from the three premises following:

  * It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
  * I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
  * It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

### Chapter 7: Meno's Paradox

### I. Meno's Paradox

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno

>it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.

* https://philosophyterms.com/menos-paradox/

>The paradox says that if you already know what you’re looking for, you don’t need to search for it because you have the answer. But if you don’t know what it is, how do you even start looking for it? This is the tricky part—you wouldn’t recognize what you’re trying to find, even if it’s right in front of you.


#### II. Questions and Problem

##### Problem:

* Obstacle or barrier
* Something you need to move out of the way
* At the end of the problem solving process , you have eliminated something
* The solution dissolves the problem
* Allows you to proceed

Aspects

* Sets a task
* No need to know why
* Solving takes the form of commands
* Symbol: Exclamation point
* Motives are exogenous to problem-solving

##### Question

* To seek, search, pursue or hunt — for an  answer
* Answer: whatever you are looking for
* Question culminates in its answer
* Nothing comes next

The state of having the answer is the state of knowing something that I do not yet know — so cannot identify for you

Aspects

* Symbol: Question mark
* Sharing or inviting
* Enticing
* Motives are endogenous to question-answering

Selecting the venue

Turning questions into problems

Socratic definition = goal of an inquiry

Other definition: to sharpen the inquiry


#### III. A Demonstration of the Socratic Method

* Virtue is knowledge
* Pushy questions inspire inquisitive answers

#### IV. Past Lives

* A leading question forces an answer
* A priori knowledge

#### V. What is Thinking?

* Thinking is a social quest for better answers to the sorts of questions that show up for us already answered.
* It is a quest because it has a guilty endpoint knowledge. It is social because it operates by resolving disagreement between people.
* Thinking is the road from ignorance about the most important things to knowledge about them
* Thinking is using the Socratic method to inquire into untimely questions

Definitions

* Dictionary ~ beholden to ordinary usage
* Stipulative ~ to define a term in a way that is not standard
* Socratic ~ at the end of a process of enquiry

Socratic Definition

* Can be target of objections

Answers

* Answers are perfectly stable

## Part Three: Socratic Answers p245

### Introduction to Part Three: The Socratizing Move p245

Socrates claims To be an expert in politics, in love, and in facing death. p245

Socrates expert on politics, love and death. p245

Despite protestations of ignorance. p245

Every philosopher has been preparing themselves for death. p246

Socrates unified domains as distinct as love, death, and politics not by analyzing them in terms of some underlying common denominator, but rather by seeing them as convergent upward toward a single aspiration. Inquiry into untimely questions. p248

Instead of arguing that these domains all have common source or calls or are built out of common materials. Socrates argues what they have in common is a goal. 

War is a form of conversation.  p248

Socrates claimed. That each of the traditional value virtues of justice, courage, moderation, and piety used to be acquainted with knowledge. Virtue is identical To say nothing other than knowledge. p248

Weakness of will is really ignorance. p248

The Socratic view is that real courage and moderation and piety and justice are manifested in speech and more specifically in the back and forth of inquisitive refutation. p249

Socrates is making the radical claim that for ignorant people like us, human goodness is primarily expressed in how a person conducts herself in inquiry, and that conversation is where we find our true home. p249


### Chapter 8 ~ Politics: Justice and Liberty p250

* autochthony ~ born from the earth ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochthon_(ancient_Greece) p250


Liberalism triad p251

* freedom of speech
* egalitarianism
* fight for social justice. 

Or: justice, freedom and equality. p271

If these claims are to be consistent with one another. The art of love, the craft of politics, and the preparation for death must be attributable the same underlying ability. p246

By inquiring into untimely questions, every philosopher has all along been preparing himself for death. p246

The practice of Socratic ignorance is a kind of mastery of the deepest things. The mechanism of this reversal is something that I call the Socratic move. p246

#### I Politicization

You cannot fight injustice. p252

When people think they are fighting injustice, they are instead imitating refutation. p252

Free if and only if it is inquisitive. p253

Politicization is the displacement of a disagreement from the context of argumentation into a 0 sum context where if one party wins, the other party loses. p254

It converts a question, which is of two positions is correct — into a competition between the interests of two parties. 

Politicization is a pathology of politics. A mapping of a disagreement into a contest. p255

Disagreement tends to fuel an eagerness to win, which manifests itself in the practices Socrates describe himself as wanting to avoid. p256

Being refuted is a greater good. p258

- is pleasant

#### II Fighting is Pretend Arguing

War, in large part, is an attempt to prove that one is right, which is to say to settle a disagreement.  p261

Fighting would be something like this. Fighting is politicized, arguing. p261

The only way to actually determine whether violence is justified is to ask the question, "is violence justified?" And inquired freely into the truth of the matter p263

Killing and saving don't touch ideas, only argument does. p264

Although you can win a fight by behaving more unjustly than your opponents, you cannot refute someone by saying that things that are even more false than what they say. p264

What you're really doing when you say you are fighting injustice is you're inflicting harm on people and imagining those arms somehow transfer to the ideas that are your real enemies. 

#### III Freedom of Speech p265

Politics is about persuasion. p267

Persuasion is flattery. 

Persuasion is in some sense what people want to hear. p269

Debate politicizes argument. p269

Debate is always a matter of convincing a third party. p269

The truth is never refuted. p270

Gamified version of refutation: The version where you win by persuading people — that someone who is saying true things can nevertheless lose p270

We live under a shared idea of how to do so. p272

Politics is the set of solutions that we develop to those difficulties in shared living that spring specifically from differences in our ideas about. How best to do so? p272

A free society is one in which disagreements about how to live together are well managed. p272

Freedom is not the same thing as the state of being unimpeded by the precedence of others — or what could be called independence p272

These facts do not represent freedom, since there are no others with whom this agreement might be managed well, more poorly. p272

It is only when our independence is the product of a shared agreement about how to live that accounts as a form of freedom. p272

Freedom is a political idea and political activities and commutative activity. p273

### Chapter 9 ~ Politics: Equality ~ p274

The moralist tells you to strive to be on par with everyone else. Where's the anti war list tells you to strive for elevated status. p274

What you really want is elevated status and equality. p275

#### I The quest for equality p275

Human interactions are replete with statistics seeking behavior. p275

Conversational status games typically involve an expectation of symmetry. We anticipate that our interlocutor will seek the same sort of recognition from us that we are seeing from them p276

People involved or you should not try to dominate one another. Rather they are participating in a shared quest for shared superiority. p276

They are trying to get the equality points at high to license the conclusion they're both in some way superior people. p276

The equality we seek in such encounters is something positive p276

It is not a default but a conversational achievement. p276

The self blowing gestures can be reconciled with satis seeking if we see them both as a quest for an elevated equality. We are trying to be high up and equal to one another. p277

#### II The Elusiveness of equality p277

We are anxious to even out the appearance of difference in abilities, in social standing, in success. p277

Much of what gets called social skill involves inducing the feeling of equality in the face of all the facts that challenge this feeling. p278

Our quest for equality tends to end in something that has been described as the conceit of equality. p278

The equality arrived at in social context is not the real thing, but only an unstable placeholder. p278

#### III Inequality p278

The quest for equality drives the ambitious person to excess. p279

Pulling yourself Above the level of the person dominating you looks like an achievement, so long as they are above you. p280


We're not sure how to put that equality point back where it belongs after we are discriminated against, because we don't actually know where it belongs. p281

The problem about egalitarianism is not new. It is ancient. p281


#### IV Egalitarianism in the Iliad p281

One data that Smith's theory explains extraordinary well is the otherwise puzzling human preference over speaking over listening. 


#### V Adam Smith p285

There is something very strange in the practice of seeking, from someone, proofs that you do not such proofs from them. 

#### VI Socratic Equality p290

If you have nothing to prove. then I am no less pleased to be persuaded than to persuade. p290

make it easy to unconvince me. p291

refutation by majority is worthless. p291

the right to truth is aspirational

Recognizing existence another mind p293

* Two of us are not of one mind
* disagreement does not close the door
* nothing counts except with reference to the other

To engage with a point of view that conflicts with your own, but to continue to engage with it as a point of view on the truth that. Is what it is to recognize someone as your equal. p293

The rule that you haven't achieved anything with your words unless the person you are talking to has come to understand your ideas on the same terms on which you understand them. That's a rule for the world within the world. p294


What defines you within the conversation is only your orientation toward the truth, which makes you an intellectual thing, a mind. p295

The ultimate form of respect is being seen in terms of one's power to help others figure out how to live. p295

Neither of us is trying to be superior to the other, but we are both trying, together, to be superior, elevated. p295

The equality we seek is not merely the absence of an evil, but the presence of a good. p295

Freedom of speech is simply the freedom to speak truly. p296

Socrates great insight was to notice that this freedom is not, under ordinary circumstances, available to us. p296

We live together because we think together. p297 

### Chapter 10 ~ Love ~ p298

Me

* Love is not a zero sum game
* Love is not exclusive but additive
* Love is measured purely in positive terms
* Love is the progress you make together
* Love is the shared understanding
* Love is the shared love of argument
* Love is the shared love of the target of shared knowledge
* The target of shared knowledge is the form of the beautiful
* Polyamoury is the kind of polyamoury that doesn't distinguish between having many lovers and having many friends
* Love is the shared search for knowledge of the beautiful, the good and the true
* Sex is a distraction from Socratic goals
* Sex is mania


***

If we compare romantic love as it appears in our lives to our romantic ideals, we find ourselves falling very far short, p298

Even the good case is far from ideal. p296

It is remarkable that romantic love has existed for thousands of years. p298

Is there a context in which romantic love would it not appear silly, or naive, but perfectly appropriate. 

#### I Socrates versus Aristophanes

What is it you human beings really want from each other? p299

What everyone loves is really nothing other than the good p299

Permanence is not the only thing we want because we will not be happy with permanent badness. 

What is it you human beings really want from each other? p299

When I love someone, I love what is good about them. p300

Socrates says "love is wanting to possess the good forever" p300 

The radical insider Socrates theory of love is that you don't need to trade the two parts of the idea against each other. You'd have rationality _and_ attachment if you're willing to rethink both.  p302

#### II Eroticized Philosophy ~ p302

Aristophonic attachment takes the form of acceptance of him, even if he is not so great. And is hard to be see how these can be combined with satisfaction with a person.  p303

We want our lovers at once to accept us as we are and admire us for what we are. p302

The proper activity for lovers is to engage in is philosophy. p303

Live a life of shared understanding.  p303

"So one thing I would not advise is that we remain as we are." p304

Love as a miss center to the disembodied form of the beautiful. p304

Socrates is saying that the sort of thing you really love bears more resemblance to an idea than to your flesh and blood lover.  p305

1 Socratic love is, by contrast, perpetually dissatisfied. 

2 Love is not a zero sum game. Loving one person more does not mean you love another person less.

Socratic love is measured purely in positive terms. nice! p307

What is romantic is the progress you make together, and you should always be open to morbid, both with that person and with others. p307

3. Preoccupation with sex will distract people from their Socratic goals. p307

4 Child raising, homemaking and comfortable companionship and so on. These are neither necessary nor sufficient for true monk romance, and have the potential to distract from it. p307

5 Poems and stories and movies that we call romantic. Often get love wrong and are in fact unromantic. p307

Socrates says that the person in love is in a state of mania. p308

The original paradox about how my love can take the individual human being as its proper target if my love does not take the individual human being as its proper target; And once that target has shifted into something divine and perfect and unimprovable, admiration and acceptance do go hand in hand.

It is indeed rational to be fully and unconditionally attached to that which cannot in any way be improved. p309

Inquiry is according to Socrates what is truly dangerous, transgressive and exciting? p310

#### III Socrates versus Henry James ~ p310

Not "falling in love" but "ascending in love" p311

Love is restless: pinning it down kills it. p311

Socratic loves takes the impulse toward the lover's ascent as an impulse to change. Lovers approach one another as inquirers and their lovers aspirational ascent to knowledge. p312

Romantic love not a solution ~ Inquisitive love offers a new form p312

#### IV A Love Story: Socrates and Alcibiades ~ p312

Direct knowledge to the target of shared knowledge p317

#### V Socratic Friendship p317

Socrates replaces a fickle love of individual people with what it imitates, a shared love of argument. p318


Revenge is incoherent - a form of hateful love p315

A shared love of argument p318

It is invitation into a shared life of considering things together, a life in which neither would shy away from confronting difficult truths. p321

What else said Beattie's takes for a refusal to offer love is precisely an offer of Socratic love. p322


#### VI Socratic Polyamory p322

If Socratic glove is philosophizing, then Socratic love is radically non exclusive. p322

Socratic love is not exclusive but additive. p322

Is there a context in which the romantic love we dream about is perfectly appropriate? 

Love is not exclusive but additive

Eros and Philia on a sliding scale p322

Socratic polyamory is the kind of polyamory that doesn't distinguish between having many lovers and having many friends. p323

#### VII Socratic Irony p323

People often think Socrates is a jerk. p323

Someone who deceptively conceals his real views while making the mockery of the people he is talking to. p233

When does Socrates mean what he says? p324

The question of Socratic irony when the Socrates mean what he says is probably the central controversy in Socratic scholarship. p324

His whole life is one big game, a game of irony. p324

Initially irony comes from the people hostile to Socrates. p326

The dividing line between Socratic irony and its absence was also in running line with the Socrates's enemy or his friend p326

Cicero view Socrates irony as an impressive and Elegant stylistic flourish, Quintillion as a noble form of humility. p326

The result is that for the contemporary Plato scholar is something good and deep and sophisticated and even somehow honest. p327

I agree that the novices are making an error about Socratic irony, but I think that the sophisticates are in fact making the very same error, to wit: believing in the existence of Socratic irony p329

#### VIII Socratic Seriousness ~ p329

I didn't just want to interpret Socrates, I wanted to be Socrates. p329

The most anyone can do is play at being at socrates p331

One human being is, to another, either a source of answers to your questions or a source of questions that challenge your answers. p332

There is no such thing as Socratic irony, except in the sense that it is indeed ironic that the man who hid his thoughts from others less than perhaps any one in the whole history of the world should have come to be credited with the concept of irony as his central contribution to humanity. p333

Socrates seems to be putting all of his cards on the table, and this strikes me as an act of great friendliness, openness, and humanity. Where I once saw Socratic irony, I now see Socratic love. p333

### Chapter 11 ~ Death p334

#### I The Consolation of Philosophy?

We are in a place designed to be explored, a place where knowledge is ours for the taking. p336

The one name of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for the dying and death. p336

I can't help thinking of it being there and as not being there. p336

Yet the thing that was supposed to make dealing with death easier has made it harder. Where is the calm and equanimity that Socrates promised me? p336

Does philosophy prepare you for death? p337

#### II Ivan Ilych ~ p337

Suppose you knew you were going to die soon. How would you prepare yourself? p337

I've been Solitude comes from the fact that he alone is confronting his death. Everyone else around him is studiously avoiding it. p338

This problem, the problem of justifying his life, is the Tolstoy problem. p340

Ivan's predicament is that death both necessitates a justification for his life and also drives him to abandon the only justification he knows. But the other significant aspect of Ivan's predicament is that he is alone. p340

The life of Ivan Ilyich turned out to be no preparation for the death of I knowledge. His life was such that he became unhinged by the prospect of death. p341

We cannot justify our lives in the attempt to do so will only convince us that life is meaningless. p343

#### III Misology, Misanthropy ~ p343

If *The Death of Ivan Ilyich* describes what it's like to be unprepared for death. The *Phaedo* shows what it's like to be prepared. p343

Socrates has lived his life. He died as he lived - philosophizing

#### IV The Conference ~ p348

#### V Corpses ~ p381

#### VI FOMO vs FONA ~ p356

FONA: Fear of never arriving. A fear of being deprived of both present and future goods. p36o

#### VII Philosophical FONA ~ p361
