# Open Socrates

The Case for a Philosophical Life


## Happiness vs Joy

## Guilt vs Shame + WEIRD

WEIRD is an acronym for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic.

Rule breaking is punished much more by guilt than by shame. A rule breaker feels guilty even when no one else has witnessed the rule breaking. In contrast, shame is felt only when there are witnesses.

Your life is full. It has no space for the question, "Why am I doing any of this?" p1

Necessities bypass the why question p1

Fifteen-minute periods p1

You make sure your thinking about how your life should go doesn't wander too far from how it is going already. p2

* "Don't make me think. Don't make me change."
* We are afraid
* We avoid thinking
* Our lives filled with a multitude of tiny decisions - leaving no space and time for the big questions. p2

### I. Tolstoy p2

Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910)

The Tolstoy Problem: "Why should I live?"

By his own lights, what Tolstoy discovered is that the examined life was not worth living. p4

Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyian strategy. p4

The name for the opposite strategy is "Socratic". p4

### II. Socrates p5

The philosopher Socrates found himself confronted with profound questions he did not know how to answer. And yet Socrates came to the conclusion that this confrontation was the best, not the worst, thing that ever happened to him. p6

Socrates presented himself as a person one can become, as a kind of person, someone imitable enough to have his persona replicated in so many dialogs and plays. p7

a midwife to ideas p7

Socrates made himself into someone that other people could be. p7

For the Oracle of Delphi, Socrates is an example. p8

Socrates understands that his wisdom is worthless.  p8

Socrates thought that anyone could become a Socrates. p8

Because Socrates understands that he is not wise. He is pleased to be shown to be wrong, and that is the kind of person he also needs Gorgias to be. p10

I count being refuted a greater good, In so far as it is a greater good for oneself to be delivered from the worst thing there is than to deliver somewhat else from it. p10

Socrates predicted that after his death, the world would be filled with Socrateses. p11

### III. Where Is Socratic Ethics

* Jeremy Benthem
* John Stuart Mill
* Henry Sidgewick

Perform the action that is likely that is likely to result in as many benefits to as many beneficiaries as possible. p11

The benefits are typically understood in terms of the presence of pleasure. And the absence of pain. And the beneficiaries are typically assumed to be human beings.

This theory is called utilitarianism. p12

**utilitarianism**  << Epicureanism.

Immanuel Kant (1724 -1804 )

A form of ethics that is focused on the ways that dignity — the infinite worth of every rational being — constrains how we are allowed to treat one another.

This system features a "categorical imperative" or absolute prohibition against using a human being as a mere tool for the benefit of others.  p12

**Kantianism**

Kant << Stoicism. p12

But

The action that best promotes the greatest good for the greatest number is not guaranteed to be the same, in all, cases as the action that shows respect for the dignity of another person. p13

Leads to the trolley problems

Savage Command: Save me. Or cooperate with us.  p13

**Neo-Aristotianism**

Someone who has been well habituated pursues happiness and pleasure by herself by means of behaving respectfully toward others, which is to say, she aims at virtue. p13

All wisdom consists solely in not thinking that you know what you do not know. p14

People will announce "question everything" without noticing that they have just uttered not a question but a command. p14

The Socratic motto is not "question everything" but "persuade or be persuaded". p15

He claims that "I know that I know nothing" is an empty gesture of skepticism, but a plan for life. p15

The key to success is to have the right kind of conversations. p15

The only sure way to treat another human being with respect is either to answer their questions or question their answers. p15

There is only one problem, which is ignorance, and there is only one solution, which is to learn. p16

***

We have met the box of rocks, and he is us.


### IV. An Incautionary Tale p18

Common message: The message is: Do philosophy, but don't overdo it.  p18

We live inside a bubble of caution and weariness that can only be sustained by maintaining the conviction that when it comes to the question of how we live our lives. We are already being intellectual and critical and thoughtful enough. The assumption is that no one, not even a professional academic philosopher, needs to be living their whole life in a philosophical manner.

This book is an argument to the contrary. It makes the case for a philosophical life. p19

It has three parts.

**Part 1** A special class of questions. Untimely questions.

**Untimely questions** are marked by the fact that we need answers to them before we are prepared to answer them. p19

Our default answers, the ones available to us absent philosophizing - come from unreliable sources. From our bodies and other people. p19

**Savage Commands** Contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act confused in haphazard ways. p19

* Kantianism the command of the group.
* Utilitarianism aims to rehabilitate the bodily command.
* Aristotelianism tries to harmonize the two commands with one another. p19


**Part 2**: The Socratic approach to untimely questions.

Each of its three parts. Inquiry, open mindedness and truth seeking. Conceals her paradox. p19

* Inquiry ~ How can one search for what one does not know? How can one recognize it when one finds it?
* Open-mindedness ~ willing to admit that you are wrong.
* Truth-Seeking ~ Pursuing the truth and avoiding falsity.  p20

**Part 3**: We examine that method's demands in the three areas of human life where Socrates thought our ignorance loomed largest. Politics, love and death. p20

Socrates solution:  Give one person the task of asserting the truth and the other person the job of avoiding falsehoods. p20

Socrates discovered that by working together with another person, we make possible forms of thinking, self-knowledge, and questioning that are foreclosed to the person who works alone. p20Socrates solution:  Give one person the task of asserting the truth and the other person the job of avoiding falsehoods. p20

Socrates discovered that by working together with another person, we make possible forms of thinking, self-knowledge, and questioning that are foreclosed to the person who works alone. p20

Socratic ethics is the ethics of living a truly philosophical life. And it tells you that the way you should conduct yourself in each of these three domains is inquisitively. It promises to make people freer and more equal, more romantic and more courageous.  p20

Socrates says that vice is ignorance. That falling in love is an attempt to ascend to another plane of existence. And if he were around today, he would accuse all of us of treating corpses in a superstitious manner.

He insists that everyone desires the good and that treating others unjustly is worse for the person who does so than being unjustly treated herself. In his hands, both freedom of speech and the egalitarianism become not political ideas but intellectual ones. He thinks that philosophy is a preparation for death. p21

The one to whom we are beholden is the character, that is the ideal, created by the historical Socrates. p21

We want to be the kind of person that the historical Socrates. No doubt imperfectly. Tried to make himself into. It is the same kind of person that played out again, no doubt imperfectly tried to copy. p21

## Part One: Untimely Questions ~ p23

## Chapter 1: the Tolstoy Problem ~ p23

What will come from what I do and from what I will do tomorrow? What will come from my whole life? p23

If most people find themselves unbothered by Tolstoy's question. Is it because they have a real answer to it, or because they have the power to ignore it? p26

### I. Questions that come too late

I want to do is. Embark upon an exhaustive existential inquiry. p26

We learned to take life 15 minutes at a time.  p26

We find a way of to avoid ever asking "what will come from my whole life"

We will find it replete with reasons for postponing philosophical inquiry. p26

Death will rescue us from ever having to come to terms with a meaninglessness of life. p26

An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time — namely, after it has been answered. p26

Untimely questions are hard to answer, But first and foremost, because they are hard to ask. And they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to post them to others. But first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself. p27

You'll be going through the motions of inquiry without actually inquiring into anything. p27

The reason why you can't ask yourself untimely questions is that you think you already have the answer to them. And the reason you think you have the answer is that you are already using the answer.

The difficulty is that we can't make use of the answer and ask ourselves a question at the same time.

### II. What Tolstoy Couldn't Do

What will come from what I do and from what I will do tomorrow — what will come from my whole life?

Why should I live? Why should I wish for anything? Why should I do anything?

Is there any meaning in my life that wouldn't be destroyed by the death that inevitably awaits me? p32

The truth was that life is nonsense. p33

Tolstoy repeatedly refers to the fundamental questions about the meaning of life. He never succeeds in asking himself those questions. p34

He admires those strong and logical people who, in his position, commit suicide. p33

If human life is meaningless, if there is nothing that we can do that would matter in any way, then that line of reasoning applies equally to suicide. To put it another way, if you think that suicide is valuable enough to perform, you think that something is valuable. And now it seems you are no longer a nihilist. p34

Life is meaningless, suicide is mandated, to which he has not reasoned, and from which his behavior repeatedly wavers. p34

Life is meaningless. Suicide is mandated, to which he has not reasoned, and from which his behavior repeatedly wavers.

### III. Enter Socrates

When we settle on answers to the central questions of our lives without ever having opened up those questions for inquiry, that is a recipe for wavering. p36

By preemptively closing the questions, they consign themselves to a lifetime of wavering. p39

### IV. Everybody Waivers p39

The Socratic interpretation is that Tolstoy did not try and fail, rather he failed to try. He confused his own failure to ask a question with a conclusive, unquestionable discovery that there was no possible answer. p39

Folk wisdom is another place to see wavering. Pick a maxim or adage, and you can usually articulate a counter-maxim that people will use to cover the case when they wish to praise the opposite. p41

Look before you leap, but he who dares wins. p41

There is no domain where our wavering is more obvious than it is in politics. And there is no one who finds it more obvious than our political opponents. p42

Wavering often takes the form of weakness of will, where we commit ourselves to one course of action and end up acting against our better judgment instead. p42

We don't act in accordance with our supposed knowledge. Instead, we act exactly as people would act who didn't know these things. p42

### V. Fiction as Refuge p42

Most of the time, when we waver, we don't notice that we are wavering. We become adept at avoiding having to acknowledge our wavering. We rationalize. p42

Passionate desire pressures us to think no more than 15 minutes ahead. p43

The only way to get through the next 15 minutes is to convince yourself that you're doing something much nobler than just getting through the next 15 minutes. p44

There are so many questions about human life that we never stop to ask ourselves. Because we're too busy moving on with our lives, deploying our answers. p44

If we never inquire into untimely questions, the thinking we use to guide our lives will be unstable. We will never be able to rely on it for very long, perhaps no more than 15 minutes or so, before it is subject to being overturned. p44

There are questions about how to

* Treat other people fairly.
* What kind of greatness to pursue in life
* What it means to love and be loved.
* How we should face death.
* How society should be organized.
* Who our real friends are.
* How to raise our children.
* What are the demands of justice?
* What to do with our lives?
P44

The troubling fact that each person routinely fails to confront the most important questions about their lives. p45

Tolstoy laments, "How often I envied the peasants for their illiteracy and lack of education. Yet how can I believe, as common people believe, steeped as they are in grossest superstitions? It is impossible, but yet their life is their life, it is normal, it is happy, it is an answer to the question." p46

The ideal for Tolstoy would be never to confront the Tolstoy problem in the first place. p46

If Tolstoy were correct, the best course of action for those unlucky enough to cross paths with the Tolstoy problem might be to postpone and postpone, 15 minutes at a time, until one runs out the clock. p46

If Tolstoy were correct, the best course For those unlucky enough to cross paths with the Tolstoy problem, it might be to postpone and postpone, 15 minutes at a time, until one runs out the clock. p46

In much the same way that a painting presents us with a landscape, but prevents us from entering it, novelists give us a view into the promised land, but not more. p47

Socrates believes that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being, and that belief motivated him to make time for untimely questions.

Novelists give us a view into the promised land, but not more. p47

Socrates thought that the Tolstoy problem could be solved. p47

Why should we care whether or not we can inquire into untimely questions? p47


***

What questions ought I be asking?


### VI. Unwavering Action p47

Why should we care whether or not we can inquire into untimely questions? p47

Socrates explains that by pursuing knowledge, which is to say by seeking a solution to the Tolstoy problem, we **stabilize** those answers.  p47

Socrates is here distinguishing an opinion that one simply has from an opinion that is formed by way of an inquisitive process. p48

When the opinion is the conclusion of a process of inquiry, whose steps can be in turn retraced (an account of the reason why), our wavering stops. p48

The thinking that we do in pursuit of an answer holds that answer fixed. Knowledge is simply the name for an answer that is the product of a completed inquiry into a question. p48

Wavering, by contrast, is a sign that one is cut off an investigation before it came to a close, or that one never even opened it. p48

What inquiry gets us are answers that are both true and stable. p49

The preference for knowledge over mere right opinion is the preference for answers that have been stabilized by inquiry. p49

The inquiry into untimely questions is the search for a life that doesn't need to be shielded from reflection. A life you live by understanding it. Viewed in this light, philosopher is not the name of a profession. It is just a way, an especially open and direct and straightforward one, of being a person. p50

## Chapter 2: Load-Bearing Answers ~ p51

### I. What is an untimely question? p55

Each of his conversations is a high-wire act in which Socrates manages to sustain an inquiry into the very question, is there, with his interlocutor, who is least likely to tolerate. These are untimely questions. p55

Some of Socrates' interlocutors are initially taken aback by how easy his questions seem. p55

Socrates' interlocutors often conflate the activity of defining the concept in question with that of showing how it applies to and affirms their own behavior. p56

There is a pattern to how many people respond to Socrates' questions. They first feel that the questions are so straightforward as to hardly deserve consideration, and then give answers that amount to performative self-affirmations. p56

I don't pause to consider how an action should be performed when I am already performing that action. p57

The belief is operational. p57

One mark of an untimely question is the availability of one's answer. It is not only that one feels certain that one has an answer, but that because that answer is currently at work in propelling one forward, the expression of the answer takes the form of using it ("Follow me"). Rather than explaining it ("This is how...") p57

Their answer will have the marks of being currently in use, because they can't take Tom off from this pursuit. p58

The most interesting and most elusive questions will be the ones whose answers we must give at every moment of our lives, for their whole duration. In terms of the degree to which we as agents rely on them, these answers bear the heaviest load. p59

We can ask someone, "Why did you decide to have children?" Or, "Why did you decide to go to graduate school?" We cannot ask, "Why did you decide to be a good person?" p60

difference between now and long term / forever

### II. Untimely, not Subjective. p61

Our standing investment in the answers to untimely questions explains their contentiousness much better than the usual Explanation, which is to dismiss these questions as "subjective".  p61

The parties themselves fight because they see the question as in some way objective, decidable in the light of the truth, in spite of the impossibility of measurement. p65

Measuring is how we check what works and what doesn't. Measurement matters. The question then is why we fight over what we can't measure. p64

We fight only when the question is subjective, in the sense that each A person sets her own answer without outside constraint. p64

The parties themselves fight because they see the question as in some way objective, decidable in the light of truth, in spite of the impossibility of measurement. p65

We fight over questions that cannot be decided by measurement, but not over all such questions, because we do not fight over matters of taste, nor over questions where the instruments of measurement have simply not been invented yet. 66

Measurement exists only when detachment is possible. p66

Questions of measurement require the one asking to go out and check. This is why untimely questions are never answerable through measurement. p66

What is distinctive about questions of measurement is not that they are objective, but that it is easy to separate the asking of the question from the answering of it. p66

Calling a question of justice subjective is a confused way of getting at the mysterious fact that the answers to such questions seem to have always been with us. p67

### III. Load-bearing Beliefs. p66

We navigate our lives by way of answers as to what things matter or have meaning. p67

Most of the answers that anchor our agency in the world concern our relationships with the people we are close to. p67

We cannot live without answers and so when some of our most important answers are or stand to be removed from us, we experience that event in the form of strong negative emotions. p67

Emotions such as rage and despair are how we respond when something that we were counting on not happening. p67

How are load-bearing answers to untimely questions tend to give rise to predictions that specify what Needs to be true in the future in order for my answer to guide my action in the present. p68

Each of us is counting on the future unfolding in some ways rather than others, even though we cannot fully control whether it does. p67/68

The name for these load-bearing predictions is HOPE. p68

The root of the problem is that we have to investigate our lives while living them. p70

When something matters to our ability to navigate our lives, we need to have a belief about what will happen, because we make use of that belief in the activity of living. p69

Trust is that species of hope that pertains to whether others will hold up their end of the bargain. p69

The reason we fight over certain questions is not that They are subjective, but because our answers to them are in use. p70

There is a limit to how much weight vice versa, such as being more objective and being more impartial, can carry, because the root of the problem is that we have to investigate our lives while living them. p70


### IV. Sadness versus Anger. p71

There seems to be a big difference between the experience of loss and the experience of being wronged or slighted or treated unjustly. p71

You can be angry _at_ a person, but you cannot be sad _at_ them. you can be sad _about_ what you lost. p71

Unlike sadness, anger is motivating. The angry person thinks there is something to be done in relation to what she is angry about, some goal to be achieved in light of the violation, and that goal involves the person she is angry at. p71

We experience anger as a _rectifiable_ disruption of an answer to an untimely question, and this rectification essentially involves other people. p72

The rectification involves other people in two ways. First, there is the person I am angry at, but often there is also the group of people I am angry alongside. Anger is in many ways a collective phenomenon. p72

Sadness is not a socially directed emotion. It doesn't drive one to adjust the social order. p73

Sadness is immobilizing and disaffecting. There is nothing it makes one do, and indeed it inclines one to spend some time doing just that, nothing. p73

The reason why there is nonetheless something to be done about anger is that the anger is fundamentally directed at the wrongdoer, on the grounds that the wrongdoer indicates a failure to give a shared answer. p73

When I am angry, I am in an unstable state where I feel that something that is supposed to be collective is held only by me and I must rectify that situation.

Holding the wrongdoer accountable promises to rehabilitate the answer by restoring its shared status. p75

Some answers to untimely questions are given only individually, whereas others are collective, given by one because they are given by a group. The first kind of answer exposes a person to sadness or fear or despair, the second kind to anger. p75

It is not clear how someone is supposed to ask a question to which she thinks she has an answer, when she is currently using that answer to guide her life p75

The load-bearing answers we give to untimely questions are both the sources of all our problems and the sources of all our reasons to care that we have problems. p76

But it is not clear how someone is supposed to ask a question to which she thinks she has an answer, when she is currently using that answer to guide her life. p76

She is not going to saw off the branch she is standing on. p76

Socrates is relentlessly consistent in prioritizing definition over praise. footnote p76

Questions that are difficult to answer because you are living them.

Sadness ~ personal versus Anger ~ group

## Chapter 3: Savage Commands ~ p77

All around you, the air is thick with commands. p77

Even when the command takes the form of some relatively sophisticated attitude, such as ambition or jealousy or existential ennui, it has physical manifestations. p77

You feel it in your gut. p77

These commands are savage, employing the tools of the torturer — pain, fear of more pain, the purely contrasting pleasure of temporary release from pain — to get you to do what you may see no other reason to do. p77

The commands are also unreliable since they have a history of not always panning out. p78

Why do we obey such savage and inconsistent masters? p78

When we disobey a command, it is usually at the prompting of another command. p78

Commands are our answers to untimely questions. p77

The question, how should I live? By the time that question shows up on the scene, there is already a way in which you are living. That means it's too late to ask. p79

When you need answers to a question before you know how to ask it, that is when you become susceptible to a form of speech that can only be described as a command. p80

A command answers the question, "what should I do?" when no one has asked it. p80

We are the sorts of beings who need answers before developing the ability to ask questions, and who therefore rely on answers to unasked questions, which is to say, commands. p80

This is why Socratic ethics opens with a critique of commands. p80


### I. The Bodily Command and the Kinship Command p81

Socrates describes bodily appetite as a source of answers to unasked questions. p80

When it comes to getting fed or hydrated or staying warm or facing some imminent threat, our bodies are ready to issue loud and definitive answers to the question, "what should I do?" The question never had to be asked. The answers somehow just come to us of their own accord. p81

Our bodies are not the only source of savage commands. p81

The bonds I have described can be thought of as a wide variety of ways in which I can see another as "akin" to myself. p82

The essential feature of kinship bonds is that they offer communal answers to questions such as which people and places and activities matter most to us? Which days do we celebrate? Under what circumstances are we willing to fight and die? Do we believe in God? What kinds of jobs? ... p82

How should we behave in relationship to each other? The kind of question that is answered and the kind of answer that is given varies depending on the kinship group. p82

The body offers an answer to what I should do in the form of the approving nod of appetitive pleasure, or the "no" of pain.
Kinship does the same, but it does so by allowing an individual to delegate the project of answering to a group. p83

A kinship relation dictates that this is how we live, here is how we do things, these are things we care about... "p83

Belonging to the group gives you an answer.

Whereas the bodily command operates by way of the carrot of pleasures, comfort, and safety, and the stick of pain and the fear of death, the kinship command operates by way of the carrot of status, honor, affection, and camaraderie, and the stick of fear of exclusion and the various social emotions, shame, pity, sympathy, envy, and so on. p83

The two commands serve up different forms of existential threat. Is the former a potential threat to my biological existence, whereas the latter concerns my social existence? p83

My reputation is identical, the same object as other people's opinions. p83

The emotion associated with the prospect of such rejection is shame. p84

Given the degree to which a a sense of self-worth is determined extrinsically, it would be more accurate to call it a sense of "other-worth". p84

We rely on the continuity of kinship relations. The fact that our people, in some sense, "our"", will live on in order to be at peace with their own individual deaths. p84

Our ability to accept that we will die, but our inability to accept the same thing about the species, is thus evidence for the grip that kinship has on us. 85

This helps explain the willingness that people sometimes have, in the context of war or other crises, to sacrifice their lives for their kin. They see the relevant question about their existence as a question about a group. 85

The pursuit of wealth is driven by the body, as is our anxious investment in our health itself, itself backed by our fear of death. 85

Someone who endures pain only for the sake of enduring less pain in the future is being ordered around just as blindly by his body as the person who yields to immediate pleasure. 85

The bodily command is thus a label for all those imperatives that address me as me, as an individual animal, not as a member of a social group. 86

Most intimate associations are a site of both bodily and kinship commands. 86

The bodily command and the kinship command underwrite much of what we do, think, and feel. 86

The bodily command is thus a leap.

My body might tell me that I have to do one thing at one time, but at a later time fill me with regrets and pains for having obeyed it. p87

The commands generated by other people, one's kin group, have the same fluctuating character. p87

Both the bodily command and the kinship command make us waver. They give us a loud, clear answer as to what we ought to do, but the answers don't last. By frequently reversing themselves, they prompt us to take life 15 minutes at a time. p87

### II. Weakness of will p88

They claim to be unwilling to do what is best, even though they know what it is and are able to do it, and to act that way because they are overcome by pleasure or pain. p88

They indulge and end up with more pain than pleasure overall. p88

The weak-willed or akratic person insisted that they wavered with their eyes open. p88

You can no more choose what you know to be worse than you can believe what you know to be false. p90

Even as you were eating the cookie, you were able to represent to yourself the future state in which you would regret it. p90

Because you understand that you will regret this choice in the future, it doesn't follow that you regret it now. p91

Socrates can allow that now you regret and remember enjoying, that back then you enjoyed and anticipated regret. p91

The body doesn't take care of itself. It wavers, judging X to be better than Y at one moment and Y to be better than X in the next. p91

It will become very clear if we do not use so many names at the same time. Pleasant and painful, good and bad. p92

We have developed the habit of using multiple words for the same thing in order to hide from ourselves the absurdity of our behavior. p92

You waver in how you act, and then you waver in how you talk about how you didn't waver when you acted. You can't even stabilize your sentences for more than a few seconds at a time. p93

***

Weakness of will is actually an inconsistency in the way we use our words. We are programmed to think of things one way at one time, and then programmed to think of things another way another time. The proof is that we use different words at the time of the event and at the time of the future.

We talk of the pleasure now and the future state of pain later.

We talk of the good now, the bad in the past.

### III. Revenge p93

Just as our bodies routinely lead us to choose what is, in bodily terms, worse, our kinship attachments routinely lead us to choose what is, in kinship terms, worse. p93

Revenge is when love wavers into hate. p93

Revenge is an act of love, that it is hateful love. p94

X is getting revenge on Y when first X sees the way he is treating Y as good because Y sees it as bad. And second, X justifies his behavior on retaliatory grounds. p94

I'm using "revenge" somewhat broadly to include all the cases where I behave hatefully toward Someone - treating harms to them as goods - and understands your behavior as a fitting response to how they act, or how they will act, or to who they are. p94

Revenge is a form of wavering, thinly disguised as non-wavering by a proliferation of terms. p94

We use multiple words for the same thing, so as to conceal our inconsistency. p94

The fundamental directive of the body is to pursue as much pleasure as possible. p94

Socrates' approach to revenge is simple: you should never ever do bad things. p95

No matter what someone did in the past or will do in the future, they did not deserve harm. p95

Being bad is not a way to be good. Harming people isn't good, it's bad. p95

There is no good way to do bad. p96

Socrates is not raising any objection to violence or killing, so long as they are justified by the good to be achieved, rather than understood as "deserved" in the light of evils done.

In revenge, the bad that is going to be done to a person is vaunted, _as_ the good to be achieved. p97

Socrates' insight is that this thought, doing good by doing bad, is essentially confused. p97

If I harm you vengefully and call that justice, I must see what I'm doing as unbalanced good, but I also have a representation of how you see it as being something that is unbalanced bad and harmful. Thus I see one and the same action at the same time as good from my point of view - on it, this is justice being done - and bad as in harmful and evil, and that's your point of view _as imagined by me_. p97

But there is a common ground: all forms of empathy, be they dark or heartwarming, begin with my feeling of what you feel.
Empathy is not a virtue, but a power. p98

Almost every adult has this power to some degree, though some of us have more of it than others, and it can be used for good or ill. p98

When faced with a repenting criminal who joyfully welcomes punishment because they correctly understand that it is really a benefit, the beneficent punisher's task only becomes much more cheerful. p98

The Vengeful Punisher Only understands the practice of punishment when it is accompanied by a vision of the punishment as being on net bad. p98

The Socratic position on revenge can be summed up as a set of truisms. **No one deserves to be harmed. It's never right to do what's wrong. Being bad can never be what makes something good.** p98

Socrates noticed a simple fact about revenge that we tend to ignore, which is that it is only possible to take revenge against kin. p98

Self-defense, as it is usually understood, hides within it the notion of revenge. p100

In so many contexts, both intimate and public, we intentionally inflict harm on those we would otherwise see ourselves as prohibited from honouring. p101

Revenge is animated by the desire to teach people lessons and set them straight. p103

Revenge makes no sense. The vengeful person insists that the wrongness of the wrong thing they are doing, the fact that their victim is suffering or dead, is what makes it right or fitting or necessary or good. p103

Neither to do wrong nor return a wrong is ever correct, nor is doing harm in return for harm done. p101

The pacifist thinks that you shouldn't kill people, whereas Socrates thinks you can't do good by doing bad. p103

Revenge is not pure hate, it is loving hate. p104

Revenge is a passion that tells you that the bitter cruelty you are forgiven for acting will be righteous and glorious. p104

Revenge and the grace shift teach us that our default systems for managing our lives are defective. They make us waver. p104

### IV. The Socratic Proposal p104

The Socratic method is an alternative to savage command. It takes the form of a proposal, either you're going to be convinced by me to go along with what I think, or you're going to convince me to go along with what you think. p106

persuade or be persuaded, Refute or be refuted. Ask questions or answer them. p106

Socrates is not in the business of changing minds. He is in the business of either changing minds or or having his own mind changed, which is to say the business of figuring out. Which of these two things should happen? p107

Socrates' alternative to savage commands allows us to transform our default answers into something different. Inquisitive answers. p108

What if you lived not off the commands but off of an understanding of what you are doing? **Liberation from the commands begins with questions**. p108

## Chapter 4: Socratic Intellectualism p110

p110
Three main branches of ethical theorizing in the West.

* Kantian Ethics, Deontology, contractualism: Constraining one's actions by respect for humanity.
* Utilitarianism, Consequentialism: The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number.
* Virtue Ethics, Aristotelianism: To act virtuously. p110

Agnes: Neo-Socratic

Common sense distinguishes between what justice demands and what is personally advantageous. Although it is valuable to do what is just and it is valuable to do what benefits oneself, everyday intuition says that these two values do not always overlap and one can be torn between them. p111

### I. The Just and the Advantageous. p111

Examples of the two commands:

The fact that the demands of one's body to escape wounds or death can stand in tension with the bonds of solidarity to behave admirably or justly in wrestling friends and relatives. p112

If weakness of will is how the bodily command wavers, undermining it itself, and revenge is how the kinship command wavers, the scenario under discussion between Socrates and Alcibiades is one in which the person wavers because the two commands come into conflict with one other. p112

The Bodily and Kinship Command are both trying to tell you what the best thing to do is, and they are giving you different answers and cannot both be right. p112

These cues lead us to conclude that the world contains two distinctive types of goods that we might pursue. Socrates thinks this is a mistake. p115

Socrates would say that self-interest and happiness and advantage are one set of names we apply to this greatest good Duty, morality, justice, and what is good for others are another set of names for the same thing. The first set of names reflect the influence of the bodily command, and the second that of the kinship command. So, there is a subjective difference between them. Nonetheless, these aren't two kinds of good out there.  p115




### II. Taming the Savage Commands. p116

Even if we considered the sum of Socrates' conversations on the question, the result would not be anything close to a conclusive case against taking guidance from body or kin. This is because Socrates is always limited by his interlocutors' questions. p116

Ancient Epicureanism offered the first attempt at an enlightened version of the bodily answer. It was an entire worldview organized around the possibility of identifying in a consistent way the set of pleasures that are natural to us. p117

When Epicurus speaks of comparative measurement, he is describing what later philosophers will call a hedonic calculus. p118

The careful, calculative selection of pleasure is the epicurean response to the problem of weakness of will. p118

Ancient Stoicism offered their first attempt at an enlightened version of the kinship answer. p119

The Stoics believe that our truest attachments are not to our families or associates or country, but to a world order governed by fixed universal laws. If you understood your place Within this larger order, you will see that within it, there can be no conflicting interests, and that you never have any reason for revenge. p119

Stoic cosmopolitanism is the ancestor of Kantian deontology, which offers an account of kinship grounded in the power of practical rationality. The correct action on Kant's theory is the one that is consistent with respect For the activity of rational thought in myself and in every other rational being, and thereby allows me to see myself as a member in an ideal universal co


### III. Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Virtue Ethics. p120

Classical utilitarianism foregrounds the maximization of pleasure, offering up a way to stabilize the bodily answer, whereas deontology foregrounds respect for each individual's place in a larger whole, stabilizing the kinship answer. p120

The war between the just and the advantageous becomes a war that cannot be articulated within incontinentism or utilitarianism, because it is a war between those theories. p122

Virtue Ethics

As long as you are well brought up, you will be equipped to act in accordance with those ideals as each situation requires without wavering. p125

When we refer, alongside Alcibiades, to the clash between justice and advantage, we are confessing our inability to give a coherent, non-wavering answer to the question, "How should I act?" The theories of Kant, Mill, Aristotle, and Socrates are designed precisely to yield such an answer. p125


### IV. The Socratic Difference p125

What should I do is a single question. If you find yourself giving two incompatible answers, that is your ignorance talking. p126

You cannot preach virtue ethics without, often dubiously, claiming to have yourself achieved a measure of moral perfection. And you cannot preach to anyone other than those who have already been well brought up, which is to say, the choir. p126

If you actually knew what you should do, you would do it. So long as you don't know, old Socrates, the proper ethical attitude is an inquisitive one. p127

As Socrates insists to Polus in Gorgias, before you pray something, you need to say what it is that you are praising. p127

Why isn't Socratic ethics already a well-established tradition of its own? p127

The answer is that Socrates' ethics is intellectualist and people have a strong and deep Aversion to Intellectualism. p127

Socrates, by contrast, believed that arguing about how one should live is real life. p128

These three features of Socratism, That we don't Now, know that if we knew, we would act on our knowledge, and that intellectual conversations are the road to becoming a good person. p128

Someone who believes that we don't know, that if we knew we would act on our knowledge, and that philosophy, the pursuit of such knowledge is the only sure road to becoming a better person. p128

Socratic intellectualism turns its back on a very basic human need. The need to already know. Congenism, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics tell us that we already know how to live. That the formula for how to do so is simply a matter of cleaning up the bodily command or cleaning up the kinship command or looking to the best ways of which people around us have Found to satisfy both at the same time. These ethical theories address the urgent demand for answers now. p130

Could it really be true that we will have to go through our whole lives, from birth to death, without ever knowing whether we are doing it right? The answer is yes. p130

Nevertheless, each of the three theories present their foundations as settled in a way that Socrates does not. p130

***
Different schools of ethical thought: Kant , Mill, Aristotle, and Virtue Ethics
Advantageous = Bodily ~ Just = Kinship
Epicurians > Bodily ~ Stoics > Kinship

Virtue > well-brought up. p125

You will always not  know — all the time.

There is no watch. Therefore, you must keep asking, "What time is it?" ;-)

### V. The Paradox of Utopia. p131

If asked to sketch an ideal society, the Kantian or Utilitarian or virtue ethicist does not find that her ethics stands in the way of doing so. p131

Utilitarianism, Kantianism, and Virtue Ethics are hostile to the idea of Utopia. p131

I don't think there's a single parenthetical more shocking to me in all of this philosophical writing than the one containing the phrase "an Armenian massacre" above. James is saying that his weak and perfect idol was so horrific it has made the experience of genocide look alluring. His explanation of what he was missing was the element of struggle in life.  p133

The world James sees us as struggling to bring about is to talk, and then when he finds himself actually inhabiting his utopia, he finds he'd rather be in a massacre. It makes no sense to insist that we spend our lives struggling and toiling to bring about a world that, if we were in it, we would recoil from. p134

The Paradox of Utopia.

It comes naturally to us to present a utopia, sarcastically, as though this were a utopia. p135

The paradox of utopia is that we don't seem to like it very much. And now we can return to Socrates, because our dislike for utopia is a point in favour of Socratic intellectualism. p135

The paradox of Utopia suggests that our thinking about how we should live may not yet be complete. p136


### VI. Plato and Socrates. p136

We experience the demands of kinship as elevating us above the selfishness of merely catering to our bodies, which is also why Kantians look down their noses at utilitarians. p136

Plato describes this situation by claiming that there is a part of the soul that reflects the demands of kinship; he calls it the spirited part. It needs to be ruled; it cannot rule itself, but it will not submit to rule by part of the soul that reflects the needs of the body, which he calls the appetitive part. p136

But even if we recognize all the ways Plato departs from Socrates and specifically acknowledge that the representation of the soul as contending an appetited part and a spirited part is unsocratic, because Socrates would instead just speak of a single soul, confused about what to do, hearing all sorts of conflicted commands, and whose confusion calls for no impossible feat of psychic surgery, only the very possible acquisition of knowledge. We should nonetheless grant that the addition of a rational part to the two other reflects an importantly Socratic insight.  p138

The idea that the function of thought is not only to help us get into what our body tells us we need, or to behave how we, our kin, want us to behave, but to ask the very question to which the other two commands provide automatic answers. This is the most important lesson that Plato learned from Socrates. p138

If the method of conscientism is legalistic and regulatory, and the method of utilitarianism is calculative and maximizing, and the method of virtue ethics is to consult one's well-habituated faculty of practical judgment, in what more precise terms can we describe the Socratic movement?

To be described in part two.

## Part Three: Socratic Answers p245

### Introduction to Part Three: The Socratizing Move p245

Socrates claims To be an expert in politics, in love, and in facing death. p245

Socrates expert on politics, love and death. p245

Despite protestations of ignorance. p245

Every philosopher has been preparing themselves for death. p246

Socrates unified domains as distinct as love, death, and politics not by analyzing them in terms of some underlying common denominator, but rather by seeing them as convergent upward toward a single aspiration. Inquiry into untimely questions. p248

Instead of arguing that these domains all have common source or calls or are built out of common materials. Socrates argues what they have in common is a goal.

War is a form of conversation.  p248

Socrates claimed. That each of the traditional value virtues of justice, courage, moderation, and piety used to be acquainted with knowledge. Virtue is identical To say nothing other than knowledge. p248

Weakness of will is really ignorance. p248

The Socratic view is that real courage and moderation and piety and justice are manifested in speech and more specifically in the back and forth of inquisitive refutation. p249

Socrates is making the radical claim that for ignorant people like us, human goodness is primarily expressed in how a person conducts herself in inquiry, and that conversation is where we find our true home. p249


### Chapter 8 ~ Politics: Justice and Liberty p250

* autochthony ~ born from the earth ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochthon_(ancient_Greece) p250


Liberalism triad p251

* freedom of speech
* egalitarianism
* fight for social justice.

Or: justice, freedom and equality. p271

If these claims are to be consistent with one another. The art of love, the craft of politics, and the preparation for death must be attributable the same underlying ability. p246

By inquiring into untimely questions, every philosopher has all along been preparing himself for death. p246

The practice of Socratic ignorance is a kind of mastery of the deepest things. The mechanism of this reversal is something that I call the Socratic move. p246

#### I Politicization

You cannot fight injustice. p252

When people think they are fighting injustice, they are instead imitating refutation. p252

Free if and only if it is inquisitive. p253

Politicization is the displacement of a disagreement from the context of argumentation into a 0 sum context where if one party wins, the other party loses. p254

It converts a question, which is of two positions is correct — into a competition between the interests of two parties.

Politicization is a pathology of politics. A mapping of a disagreement into a contest. p255

Disagreement tends to fuel an eagerness to win, which manifests itself in the practices Socrates describe himself as wanting to avoid. p256

Being refuted is a greater good. p258

- is pleasant

#### II Fighting is Pretend Arguing

War, in large part, is an attempt to prove that one is right, which is to say to settle a disagreement.  p261

Fighting would be something like this. Fighting is politicized, arguing. p261

The only way to actually determine whether violence is justified is to ask the question, "is violence justified?" And inquired freely into the truth of the matter p263

Killing and saving don't touch ideas, only argument does. p264

Although you can win a fight by behaving more unjustly than your opponents, you cannot refute someone by saying that things that are even more false than what they say. p264

What you're really doing when you say you are fighting injustice is you're inflicting harm on people and imagining those arms somehow transfer to the ideas that are your real enemies.

#### III Freedom of Speech p265

Politics is about persuasion. p267

Persuasion is flattery.

Persuasion is in some sense what people want to hear. p269

Debate politicizes argument. p269

Debate is always a matter of convincing a third party. p269

The truth is never refuted. p270

Gamified version of refutation: The version where you win by persuading people — that someone who is saying true things can nevertheless lose p270

We live under a shared idea of how to do so. p272

Politics is the set of solutions that we develop to those difficulties in shared living that spring specifically from differences in our ideas about. How best to do so? p272

A free society is one in which disagreements about how to live together are well managed. p272

Freedom is not the same thing as the state of being unimpeded by the precedence of others — or what could be called independence p272

These facts do not represent freedom, since there are no others with whom this agreement might be managed well, more poorly. p272

It is only when our independence is the product of a shared agreement about how to live that accounts as a form of freedom. p272

Freedom is a political idea and political activities and commutative activity. p273

### Chapter 9 ~ Politics: Equality ~ p274

The moralist tells you to strive to be on par with everyone else. Where's the anti war list tells you to strive for elevated status. p274

What you really want is elevated status and equality. p275

#### I The quest for equality p275

Human interactions are replete with statistics seeking behavior. p275

Conversational status games typically involve an expectation of symmetry. We anticipate that our interlocutor will seek the same sort of recognition from us that we are seeing from them p276

People involved or you should not try to dominate one another. Rather they are participating in a shared quest for shared superiority. p276

They are trying to get the equality points at high to license the conclusion they're both in some way superior people. p276

The equality we seek in such encounters is something positive p276

It is not a default but a conversational achievement. p276

The self blowing gestures can be reconciled with satis seeking if we see them both as a quest for an elevated equality. We are trying to be high up and equal to one another. p277

#### II The Elusiveness of equality p277

We are anxious to even out the appearance of difference in abilities, in social standing, in success. p277

Much of what gets called social skill involves inducing the feeling of equality in the face of all the facts that challenge this feeling. p278

Our quest for equality tends to end in something that has been described as the conceit of equality. p278

The equality arrived at in social context is not the real thing, but only an unstable placeholder. p278

#### III Inequality p278

The quest for equality drives the ambitious person to excess. p279

Pulling yourself Above the level of the person dominating you looks like an achievement, so long as they are above you. p280


We're not sure how to put that equality point back where it belongs after we are discriminated against, because we don't actually know where it belongs. p281

The problem about egalitarianism is not new. It is ancient. p281


#### IV Egalitarianism in the Iliad p281

One data that Smith's theory explains extraordinary well is the otherwise puzzling human preference over speaking over listening.


#### V Adam Smith p285

There is something very strange in the practice of seeking, from someone, proofs that you do not such proofs from them.

#### VI Socratic Equality p290

If you have nothing to prove. then I am no less pleased to be persuaded than to persuade. p290

make it easy to unconvince me. p291

refutation by majority is worthless. p291

the right to truth is aspirational

Recognizing existence another mind p293

* Two of us are not of one mind
* disagreement does not close the door
* nothing counts except with reference to the other

To engage with a point of view that conflicts with your own, but to continue to engage with it as a point of view on the truth that. Is what it is to recognize someone as your equal. p293

The rule that you haven't achieved anything with your words unless the person you are talking to has come to understand your ideas on the same terms on which you understand them. That's a rule for the world within the world. p294


What defines you within the conversation is only your orientation toward the truth, which makes you an intellectual thing, a mind. p295

The ultimate form of respect is being seen in terms of one's power to help others figure out how to live. p295

Neither of us is trying to be superior to the other, but we are both trying, together, to be superior, elevated. p295

The equality we seek is not merely the absence of an evil, but the presence of a good. p295

Freedom of speech is simply the freedom to speak truly. p296

Socrates great insight was to notice that this freedom is not, under ordinary circumstances, available to us. p296

We live together because we think together. p297

### Chapter 10 ~ Love ~ p298

Me

* Love is not a zero sum game
* Love is not exclusive but additive
* Love is measured purely in positive terms
* Love is the progress you make together
* Love is the shared understanding
* Love is the shared love of argument
* Love is the shared love of the target of shared knowledge
* The target of shared knowledge is the form of the beautiful
* Polyamoury is the kind of polyamoury that doesn't distinguish between having many lovers and having many friends
* Love is the shared search for knowledge of the beautiful, the good and the true
* Sex is a distraction from Socratic goals
* Sex is mania


***

If we compare romantic love as it appears in our lives to our romantic ideals, we find ourselves falling very far short, p298

Even the good case is far from ideal. p296

It is remarkable that romantic love has existed for thousands of years. p298

Is there a context in which romantic love would it not appear silly, or naive, but perfectly appropriate.

#### I Socrates versus Aristophanes

What is it you human beings really want from each other? p299

What everyone loves is really nothing other than the good p299

Permanence is not the only thing we want because we will not be happy with permanent badness.

What is it you human beings really want from each other? p299

When I love someone, I love what is good about them. p300

Socrates says "love is wanting to possess the good forever" p300

The radical insider Socrates theory of love is that you don't need to trade the two parts of the idea against each other. You'd have rationality _and_ attachment if you're willing to rethink both.  p302

#### II Eroticized Philosophy ~ p302

Aristophonic attachment takes the form of acceptance of him, even if he is not so great. And is hard to be see how these can be combined with satisfaction with a person.  p303

We want our lovers at once to accept us as we are and admire us for what we are. p302

The proper activity for lovers is to engage in is philosophy. p303

Live a life of shared understanding.  p303

"So one thing I would not advise is that we remain as we are." p304

Love as a miss center to the disembodied form of the beautiful. p304

Socrates is saying that the sort of thing you really love bears more resemblance to an idea than to your flesh and blood lover.  p305

1 Socratic love is, by contrast, perpetually dissatisfied.

2 Love is not a zero sum game. Loving one person more does not mean you love another person less.

Socratic love is measured purely in positive terms. nice! p307

What is romantic is the progress you make together, and you should always be open to morbid, both with that person and with others. p307

3. Preoccupation with sex will distract people from their Socratic goals. p307

4 Child raising, homemaking and comfortable companionship and so on. These are neither necessary nor sufficient for true monk romance, and have the potential to distract from it. p307

5 Poems and stories and movies that we call romantic. Often get love wrong and are in fact unromantic. p307

Socrates says that the person in love is in a state of mania. p308

The original paradox about how my love can take the individual human being as its proper target if my love does not take the individual human being as its proper target; And once that target has shifted into something divine and perfect and unimprovable, admiration and acceptance do go hand in hand.

It is indeed rational to be fully and unconditionally attached to that which cannot in any way be improved. p309

Inquiry is according to Socrates what is truly dangerous, transgressive and exciting? p310

#### III Socrates versus Henry James ~ p310

Not "falling in love" but "ascending in love" p311

Love is restless: pinning it down kills it. p311

Socratic loves takes the impulse toward the lover's ascent as an impulse to change. Lovers approach one another as inquirers and their lovers aspirational ascent to knowledge. p312

Romantic love not a solution ~ Inquisitive love offers a new form p312

#### IV A Love Story: Socrates and Alcibiades ~ p312

Direct knowledge to the target of shared knowledge p317

#### V Socratic Friendship p317

Socrates replaces a fickle love of individual people with what it imitates, a shared love of argument. p318


Revenge is incoherent - a form of hateful love p315

A shared love of argument p318

It is invitation into a shared life of considering things together, a life in which neither would shy away from confronting difficult truths. p321

What else said Beattie's takes for a refusal to offer love is precisely an offer of Socratic love. p322


#### VI Socratic Polyamory p322

If Socratic glove is philosophizing, then Socratic love is radically non exclusive. p322

Socratic love is not exclusive but additive. p322

Is there a context in which the romantic love we dream about is perfectly appropriate?

Love is not exclusive but additive

Eros and Philia on a sliding scale p322

Socratic polyamory is the kind of polyamory that doesn't distinguish between having many lovers and having many friends. p323

#### VII Socratic Irony p323

People often think Socrates is a jerk. p323

Someone who deceptively conceals his real views while making the mockery of the people he is talking to. p233

When does Socrates mean what he says? p324

The question of Socratic irony when the Socrates mean what he says is probably the central controversy in Socratic scholarship. p324

His whole life is one big game, a game of irony. p324

Initially irony comes from the people hostile to Socrates. p326

The dividing line between Socratic irony and its absence was also in running line with the Socrates's enemy or his friend p326

Cicero view Socrates irony as an impressive and Elegant stylistic flourish, Quintillion as a noble form of humility. p326

The result is that for the contemporary Plato scholar is something good and deep and sophisticated and even somehow honest. p327

I agree that the novices are making an error about Socratic irony, but I think that the sophisticates are in fact making the very same error, to wit: believing in the existence of Socratic irony p329

#### VIII Socratic Seriousness ~ p329

I didn't just want to interpret Socrates, I wanted to be Socrates. p329

The most anyone can do is play at being at socrates p331

One human being is, to another, either a source of answers to your questions or a source of questions that challenge your answers. p332

There is no such thing as Socratic irony, except in the sense that it is indeed ironic that the man who hid his thoughts from others less than perhaps any one in the whole history of the world should have come to be credited with the concept of irony as his central contribution to humanity. p333

Socrates seems to be putting all of his cards on the table, and this strikes me as an act of great friendliness, openness, and humanity. Where I once saw Socratic irony, I now see Socratic love. p333

### Chapter 11 ~ Death p334

#### I The Consolation of Philosophy?

The magic of Steve was that his questions, his observations, his calm, cheerful insistence on staying on topic when you thought you'd exhausted it. The sort of insistence that from anyone else would come across as stubborn, but that with him came office. Gentle resoluteness, his very presence had the effect of solidifying ideas and giving them substance. p335

We are in a place designed to be explored, a place where knowledge is ours for the taking. p336

A man who has truly spent his life in philosophy is probably right to be a good cheer in the face of death. p336

The one name of those who practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for the dying and death. p336

I can't help thinking of it being there and as not being there. p336
