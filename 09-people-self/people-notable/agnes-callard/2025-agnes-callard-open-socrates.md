# Open Socrates

* The Case for a Philosophical Life

## Introduction: The man whose name is an example ~ p1

Your life is full. It has no space for the question, "Why am I doing any of this?"

Necessities bypass the why question.  ~ p1

Fifteen-minute periods p1

You make sure your thinking about how your life should go doesn't wander too far from how it is going already. p2

### I.Tolstoy p2 

Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910)

The Tolstoy Problem: "Why should I live?"

By his own lights, what Tolstoy discovered is that the examined life was not worth living. p4

Taking life 15 minutes at a time is a Tolstoyian strategy. p4

The name for the opposite strategy is "Socratic". p4

### II. Socrates p5

The philosopher Socrates found himself confronted with profound questions he did not know how to answer. And yet Socrates came to the conclusion that this confrontation was the best, not the worst, thing that ever happened to him. p6

Socrates presented himself as a person one can become, as a Kind of person, someone imitable enough to have his persona replicated in so many dialogs and plays. p7

a midwife to ideas p7

Socrates made himself into someone that other people could be. p7

For the Oracle of Delphi, Socrates is an example. p8

Socrates understands that his wisdom is worthless.  p8

Socrates thought that anyone could become a Socrates. p8

Because Socrates understands that he is not wise. He is pleased to be shown to be wrong, and that is the kind of person he also needs Gorgias to be. p10

I count being refuted a greater good, In so far as it is a greater good for oneself to be delivered from the worst thing there is than to deliver somewhat else from it. p10

Socrates predicted that after his death, the world would be filled with Socrateses. p11 

### III. Where Is Socratic Ethics


* Jeremy Benthem
* John Stuart Mill
* Henry Sidgewick

That is likely to result in as many benefits to as many beneficiaries as possible. p11

The benefits are typically understood in terms of the presence of pleasure. And the absence of pain. And the beneficiaries are typically assumed to be human beings. 

This theory is called utilitarianism. p12


Immanuel Kant (1724 -1804 )

A form of ethics that is focused on the ways that dignity — the infinite worth of every rational being — constrains how we are allowed to treat one another. 

This system features a "categorical imperative" or absolute prohibition against using a human being as a mere tool for the benefit of others.  p12

utilitarianism  << Epicureanism. 

Kant << Stoicism. p12

But

The action that best promotes the greatest good for the greatest number is not guaranteed to be the same, in all, cases as the action that shows respect for the dignity of another person. p13

Leads to the trolley problems

Savage Command: Save me. Or cooperate with us.  p13

Neo-Aristotianism

Someone who has been well habituated pursues happiness and pleasure by herself by means of behaving respectfully toward others, which is to say, she aims at virtue. p13

People will announce "question everything" without noticing that they have just uttered not a question but a command. 

The Socratic motto is not "question everything" but "persuade or be persuaded". p15 

### IV. An Incautionary Tale

The message is: Do philosophy, but don't overdo it.  p18

We live inside a bubble of caution and weariness that can only be sustained by maintaining the conviction that when it comes to the question of how we live our lives. We are already being intellectual and critical and thoughtful enough. The assumption is that no one, not even a professional academic philosopher, needs to be living their whole life in a philosophical manner. 

This book is an argument to the contrary. It makes the case for a philosophical life. p19


It has three parts. 

**Part 1** A special class of questions. Untimely questions. 

**Untimely questions** are marked by the fact that we need answers to them before we are prepared to answer them. p19

Our default answers, the ones available to us absent philosophizing - Come from unreliable sources. Our bodies and other people. p19

**savage commands** Contradicting one another and themselves, leading us to act confused in haphazard ways. p19Nice evening. Where did you go? Tomorrow OK. 

* Utilitarianism aims to rehabilitate the bodily command. 
* Kantianism the command of the group. 
* Aristotelianism tries to harmonize the two commands with one another. p19

Socrates solution:  Give one person the task of asserting the truth and the other person the job of avoiding falsehoods. p20


**Part 2**: The Socratic approach to untimely questions. 

Each of its three parts. Inquiry, open mindedness and truth seeking. Conceals her paradox. p19

* Inquiry ~ How can one search for what one does not know? How can one recognize it when one finds it? 
* Open-mindedness ~ willing to admit that you are wrong. 
* Truth-Seeking ~ Pursuing the truth and avoiding falsity.  p20

**Part 3**: We examine that method's demands in the three areas of human life where Socrates thought our ignorance loomed largest. Politics, love and death. p20

Socratic ethics is the ethics of living a truly philosophical life. And it tells you that the way you should conduct yourself in each of these three domains is inquisitively. It promises to make people freer and more equal, more romantic and more courageous.  p20

Soccerty says that vice is ignorance. That falling in love is an attempt to ascend to another plane of existence. And if he were around today, he would accuse all of us of treating corpses in a superstitious manner. 

He insists that everyone desires the good and that treating others unjustly is worse for the person who does so than being unjustly treated herself. In his hands, both freedom of speech and the egalitarianism become not political ideas but intellectual ones. He thinks that philosophy is a preparation for death. p21

We want to be the kind of person that the historical Socrates. No doubt imperfectly. Tried to make himself into. It is the same kind of person that played out again, no doubt imperfectly tried to copy. p21

"Why am I doing any of this?"

## Part One: Untimely Questions ~ p23

## Chapter 1: the Tolstoy Problem

What will come from what I do and from what I will do tomorrow? What will come from my whole life? p23

If most people find themselves unbothered by Tolstoy's question. Is it because they have a real answer to it, or because they have the power to ignore it? p26

### I. Questions that come too late

I want to do is. Embark upon an exhaustive existential inquiry. p26

We learned to take life 15 minutes at a time.  p26

We find a way of to avoid ever asking "what will come from my whole life?"

We will find it replete with reasons for postponing philosophical inquiry. p26

Death will rescue us from ever having to come to terms with a meaninglessness of life. p26

An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time — namely, after it has been answered. p26

Untimely questions are hard to answer, But first and foremost, because they are hard to ask. And they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to post them to others. But first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself. p27

You'll be going through the motions of inquiry without actually inquiring into anything. p27

The reason why you can't ask yourself untimely questions is that you think you already have the answer to them. And the reason you think you have the answer is that you are already using the answer. 

The difficulty is that we can't make use of the answer and ask ourselves a question at the same time. 

### II. What Tolstoy Couldn't Do


### III. Enter Socrates


### IV. Everybody Waivers

### V. Fiction as Refuge

Socrates thought that the Tolstoy problem could be solved. p47

### VI. Unwavering Action


## Chapter 2: Load-Bearing Answers p51

## Chapter 3: Savage Commands

## Chapter 4: Socratic Intellectualism

## Part Two: The Socratic Method

## Chapter 5: The Gadflu-Midwife Paradox

## Chapter 6: Moore's Paradox of Self Knowledge

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox
* The more fundamental manner of stating the problem starts from the three premises following:

  * It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
  * I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
  * It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

### Chapter 7: Meno's Paradox

### I. Meno's Paradox

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno

>it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.

* https://philosophyterms.com/menos-paradox/

>The paradox says that if you already know what you’re looking for, you don’t need to search for it because you have the answer. But if you don’t know what it is, how do you even start looking for it? This is the tricky part—you wouldn’t recognize what you’re trying to find, even if it’s right in front of you.


#### II. Questions and Problem

##### Problem:

* obstacle or barrier
* Something you need to move out of the way
* At the end of the problem solving process , you have eliminated something
* The solution dissolves the problem
* Allows you to proceed

Aspects

* Sets a task
* No need to know why
* Solving takes the form of commands
* Symbol: Exclamation point
* Motives are exogenous to problem-soving

##### Question

* To seek, search, pursue or hunt — for an  answer
* Anser: whatever you are looking for
* Question culminates in its answer
* Nothing comes next

The state of having the answer is the state of knowing something that I do not yet know — so cannot identify for you

Aspects

* Symbol: Question mark
* Sharing or inviting
* Enticing

* Motives are endogenous to question-answering

Selecting the venue

Turning questions into problems

Socratic definition = goal of aninquiry

Other definition: to sharpen the inquiry


#### III. A Demonstration of the Socratic Method

* Virtue is knowledge
* Pushy questions inspire inquisitive answers

#### IV. Past Lives

* A leading question forces an answer
* A priori knowledge

#### V. What is Thinking?

* Thinking is a social quest for better answers to the sorts of questions that show up for us already answered.
* It is a quest because it has a guilty endpoint knowledge. It is social because it operates by resolving disagreement between people.
* Thinking is the road from ignorance about the most important things to knowledge about them
* Thinking is using the Socratic method to inquire into untimely questions

Definitions

* Dictionary ~ beholden to ordinary usage
* Stipulative ~ to define a term in a way that is not standard
* Socratic ~ at the end of a process of enquiry

Socratic Definition

* Can be target of objections

Answers

* Answers are perfectly stable
