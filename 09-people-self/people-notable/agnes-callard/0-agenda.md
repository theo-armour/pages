# Agnes Callard Agenda

## Me

* Enjoy discussing
* Always seeking agreement

## Difficulties

* If we can't agree on this point, might there not be one where we can agree on? And then use that agreement to be able to move on to something closer to the original topic?
* AI: I am not seeking to convince you of my views, but rather to find out what you think and why you think it
* Seeking the refutation of my own views
* This is how we learn

## Typical issues with the way I discuss

* I don't let you know that what I am seeking is agreement - even if it needs the refutation of my own views
* I listen well but without letting you know because I jump too fast to the next thought ~ you may think that I am not listening
* I often push too hard on: do you understand what I mean? Where I'm coming from?
