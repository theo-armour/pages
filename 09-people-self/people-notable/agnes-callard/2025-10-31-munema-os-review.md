## II Major concepts

### Untimely questions:

“An untimely question is a question that comes at the wrong time—namely, after it has been answered. Untimely questions are remarkable not only because they are hard to answer, but, first and foremost, because they are hard to ask; and they are hard to ask not only because it is hard to pose them to others, but, first and foremost, because it is hard to pose them to oneself…The reason why you can’t ask yourself untimely questions is that you think you already have the answer to them, and the reason you think you have the answer is that you are using the answer. Such questions don’t show up to you as questions; by the time you get them in view, you find that they have hardened into the shape of answers.”

### Load-bearing answers:

The answers to untimely questions, held over a long period of time, and causing intense emotions like anger, grief, and fear if disrupted.

### Savage commands:

“When you need answers to a question before you know how to ask it, that is when you become susceptible to a form of speech that can only be described as a command…We are the sorts of beings who need answers before developing the ability to ask questions, and who therefore rely on answers to unasked questions.” The reason it is called a command is because it is not an answer to a question, but a command that one must follow without much thought. In contrast, “the Socratic method is an alternative to savage commands. It takes the form of a proposal: either you are going to be convinced by me, to go along with what I think, or you are going to convince me to go along with what you think.”

### Bodily commands:

The body answering untimely questions by telling you to pursue pleasure. For example: care about your personal interests.

### Kinship commands:

Communal (family, friends, societies) answers to untimely questions, i.e. societal dictates on how to live, what to care about, etc. For example: care about courage, fairness, etc.

### Wavering:

“Refusing to say the same things about the same subjects” i.e. “disagreeing with oneself,” which is “a sign that one has cut off an investigation before it came to a close, or that one never even opened it.” Because we don’t genuinely inquire into questions and instead follow commands, we “consign ourselves to a lifetime of wavering.”

### Socratic ethics:

An intellectualist ethics that posits that if one knows, then one acts correctly. So if one does not know, the only thing to do is to ask questions and inquire into these things. “So long as you don’t know, holds Socrates, the proper ethical attitude is an inquisitive one.” “The hard work of struggling to be a good, virtuous, ethical person—Socrates understands that work as, first and foremost, intellectual work. These three features of Socratism “that we don’t now know, that if we knew we would act on our knowledge, and that intellectual conversations are the road to becoming a good person” add up to an intellectualism.”

### Thinking:

“using the Socratic method to inquire into untimely questions,” where the method is “a social quest for better answers to the sorts of questions that show up for us already answered. It is a quest because it has a built-in endpoint: knowledge. It is social because it operates by resolving disagreements between people. Thinking begins when Socrates, or someone like him, recognizes that his account of justice, or piety, or love is not as good as it could be, which is to say, that it does not qualify as knowledge. This realization prompts him to ask another person for help inquiring into questions…the two parties come to agree. This does not mean that the quest is completed: both parties can go on to subject what they have agreed on to further tests of the same kind in future disagreements with others… It is completed when one arrives at an answer that is perfectly stable. The arguments with which it has been definitively “tied down” can then be conveyed to others, and this is why, if one has knowledge, one can teach it to others. Thinking is the road from ignorance about the most important things to knowledge about them.” Of note, thinking has to subject to standards of thoughtfulness (i.e. daydreaming is not thinking), and thinking is a process that can be applied to any topic (unlike e.g. addition).

### FONA (fear of never arriving):

“a fear of being deprived of both present and future goods: if I will never arrive at the goal of the activity I am currently engaged in, then I might as well not have done any of it.” This is the primary fear of a philosopher, i.e. that her inquiries will never be answered. The response to this, so that one does not give into despair, is some mixture of hope and faith in a general philosophical community. In contrast to Socratic hope, Tolstoy is engulfed by FONA and despairs of his life ever being enough to answer existential questions; thus, he never begins to inquire.
