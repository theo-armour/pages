>Poe’s chief complaint about Boston writers was that they were didactic. They used their poetry and fiction to argue their causes — abolition, women’s rights, social reform. To Poe, such writing should entertain and move. He believed in art for art’s sake.

> “He who pleases is of more importance to his fellow man than he who instructs,” Poe wrote.
