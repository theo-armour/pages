# Thomas Jefferson: ~ "Your candles shine as bright as my candle"

Thinking about the process of enlightenment, reminds me of another useful quote.

“He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” —Thomas Jefferson https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson
