### Chapter 6: Moore's Paradox of Self Knowledge

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox
* The more fundamental manner of stating the problem starts from the three premises following:

  * It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
  * I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
  * It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

### Chapter 7: Meno's Paradox

### I. Meno's Paradox

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meno

>it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.

* https://philosophyterms.com/menos-paradox/

>The paradox says that if you already know what you’re looking for, you don’t need to search for it because you have the answer. But if you don’t know what it is, how do you even start looking for it? This is the tricky part—you wouldn’t recognize what you’re trying to find, even if it’s right in front of you.


#### II. Questions and Problem

##### Problem:

* obstacle or barrier
* Something you need to move out of the way
* At the end of the problem solving process , you have eliminated something
* The solution dissolves the problem
* Allows you to proceed

Aspects

* Sets a task
* No need to know why
* Solving takes the form of commands
* Symbol: Exclamation point
* Motives are exogenous to problem-soving

##### Question

* To seek, search, pursue or hunt — for an  answer
* Anser: whatever you are looking for
* Question culminates in its answer
* Nothing comes next

The state of having the answer is the state of knowing something that I do not yet know — so cannot identify for you

Aspects

* Symbol: Question mark
* Sharing or inviting
* Enticing

* Motives are endogenous to question-answering

Selecting the venue

Turning questions into problems

Socratic definition = goal of aninquiry

Other definition: to sharpen the inquiry


#### III. A Demonstration of the Socratic Method

* Pushy questions inspire inquisitive answers

#### IV. Past Lives

* A leading question forces an answer
* A priori knowledge

#### V. What is Thinking?

* Thinking is a social quest for better answers to the sorts of questions that show up for us already answered.
* It is a quest because it has a guilty endpoint knowledge. It is social because it operates by resolving disagreement between people.
* Thinking is the road from ignorance about the most important things to knowledge about them
* Thinking is using the Socratic method to inquire into untimely questions
