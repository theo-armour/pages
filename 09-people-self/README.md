### Wildcard Person

You know that person on your team who seems to be good at everything? I mean the literal definition of the word good. Not master. Good.

When a problem comes up that nobody else has any experience with, this person volunteers to jump in head-first.

They don't produce masterpieces, but that was never the intention. The intention was for the problem to be solved, which it now is.
