* Design thinking is good for innovation, creativity, [thinking outside of the box]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_outside_the_box ), ideation, re-imaginiing, dealing with unknown unknowns, and being curious about the possibilities
* Systems thinking is good for solving problems, finding the best answer, dealing with very large numbers of known unknowns

### What is Design Thinking?

* https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking

> Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Involving five phases—Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test—it is most useful to tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown.
