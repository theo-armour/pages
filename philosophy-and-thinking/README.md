> Charlie also addresses the importance of recognizing patterns to determine how humans behave, both rationally and irrationally. He shares with us his checklist of twenty-five standard causes of human misjudgment, which contains observations that are ingenious, counterintuitive, and important—values Charlie treasures in the work of other great thinkers throughout history. He also emphasizes the “lollapalooza” power of psychological misjudgments in combination.

## heuristics

Like all human beings, they unconsciously rely on quick rules that simplify complex decisions. Psychologists and economists call these mental shortcuts “heuristics.”

the “win-stay/lose-shift” heuristic, which has been seen in birds, bees, rats, monkeys, children and adults. According to this heuristic, individuals stick with a strategy until they experience a “loss,” such as a labor-and-delivery complication. At that point, they switch strategies – like trying a different delivery mode.

>The ability to thinking about abstract ideas and situations is the key hallmark of the formal operational stage of cognitive development. The ability to systematically plan for the future and reason about hypothetical situations are also critical abilities that emerge during this stage.

Ability to develop a theory

Much as I think the Heritage is a good place for me, it is not a venue for intellectual thought. It gives me a place to belong to and much intimacy. But not a lot of abstraction.

### How to find the right therapist

* https://www.getrevue.co/profile/Recomendo/issues/tangoes-arduino-clone-uppercase-710972

Here is some great advice on how to find the right therapist. One of the first steps is to figure out what kind of therapeutic framework you need. When I first started therapy I had anxiety that sometimes resulted in panic attacks. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy taught me how to redirect a thought so that it doesn’t create overwhelming feelings that would affect my behavior. Now, 8 years later, I have a person-centered therapist that I talk to about all aspects of my life. Each session feels like I’m catching up with my very insightful and intelligent friend who I can vent to and ask for advice. I always tell my friends that you are allowed to break up with your therapist if the fit isn’t right. I saw three therapists before I found my most recent one, who I’ve been seeing for three years now. Finding the “right therapist” feels like you’ve acquired a super power. — CD

>The Problem
>We all read books that suggest a change – about our habits, about starting a business, fixing our psyche, and ourselves in general – but we rarely do anything with the information we are so quick to ingest. In most situations, we read something and quickly move on to the next “big” idea, never fully understanding the real context of what we have consumed.
>
>The Solution
>Thinkers Club is designed to help you focus on thinking and doing. Instead of speed-read all available books and torture your easily distracted mind with 24/7 content consumption, you focus on one topic, one book each month. Once you join, every month, you’ll receive a Think Workbook (a practical guide outlining the key strategies from a single book followed by guided writing exercises) so you can engage with the content like never before.
