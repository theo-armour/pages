* Decide when and where mental models may be useful
* Identify overlaps with do-know-be and mission-value-vision

## Reference

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model

> A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.

How to Solve Any Algorithm

1. Understand the problem.
2. Make a plan.
3. Execute the plan.
4. Evaluate the result.

Computational Thinking

1. Decomposition ~ breaking a problem down into smaller parts
2. Generalization ~ recognized patterns
3. Abstraction ~ remove the details, form a conceptual model, focus on the relationships.
4. Algorithms ~ write a series of repeatable steps to solve problem; evaluate its success.
