## Concept

My digital commonplace book

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book

I have been creating, editing and hoarding digital knowledge since the late 1970s. Sadly. I hoarded the data using whatever system was most popular at the time the data was recorded. Currently I have stuff on the following platforms:

* Text files maintained using PGP
* Evernote
* Google Drive
* Dropbox
* OneDrive
* GitHub
* GitLab
* WordPress
* Blogger
* Tumblr
* Medium
* Twitter
* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Instagram
* Flickr
* Geni
* YouTube
* Chat GPT
* And probably elsewhere as well
* And not including stuff stored on Palm Pilots, Blackberries anf countless other devices
* And not including paper pages in FiloFax and other formats

You are looking at the latest incantation. Only notes starting from sometime in 2022 have been added here.

## Vision

* A single place to store all my digital knowledge
* All my previous efforts are copied to here or linked to from here
* The data is stored in a format that is easy to:
* read and edit
* search
* share
* backup
* transform to other formats
* User interface is simple and intuitive

## Mission

* Format is GitHub flavored Markdown
* Categories follow Wikipedia categories
* https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#00-journal/2022-12-06-notes-catalogs-tags.md
* Standards generally follow Wikipedia standards
* User interface is HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript


## To Do / Wish List

* 2023-10-12 ~ fix document title
* Bring over notes from all the other older data hoards
* Transform my categories used elsewhere to Wikipedia categories
* Update TooToo - the content management system (CMS) used to build this site
* update: grv-github-repo-tree-view.html
