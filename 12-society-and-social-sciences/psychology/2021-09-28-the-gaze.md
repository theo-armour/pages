<summary>Concept</summary>

"The Gaze", "The Male Gaze", "The Female Gaze" are all well observed, developed and described memes. And, as with any old trope, there's always room for new scope.

## Mission
There is no wish to disturb the existing and very valid current polemics.

The intent here is to bring into view aspects of The Gaze - the daze - that may have not yet been seen.

## Vision

The overarching perspective is to consider how The Gaze fits into the concept of beauty and its apparent necessity in biological terms

## Song lyrics

Lyrics that do not identify the sex of the observers in locations where there are likely to be members of a variety of sexual orientations

#### The Girl From Ipanema

Antônio Carlos Jobim

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes
Goes "a-a-a-h"

When she walks she's like a samba
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes "a-a-a-h"

Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile, but she
Doesn't see. She just doesn't see
No, she just doesn't

#### Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini

Songwriters: Paul Vance / Lee Pockriss

She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was as nervous as she could be
She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was afraid that somebody would see
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini
So in the locker she wanted to stay.
Two, three, four, stick around we'll tell you more!

She was afraid to come out in the open
And so a blanket around her she wore.
She was afraid to come out in the open.
And so she sat bundled up on the shore.
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
So in the blanket she wanted to stay.
Two, three, four, stick around we'll tell you more!

Now she is afraid to come out of the water.
And I wonder what she's gonna do.
'Cause she's afraid to come out of the water.
And now the poor little girl's turning blue.
Two, three, four, tell the people what she wore!

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
That she wore for the first time today.
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini.
So in the water she wanted to stay.

From the locker to the blanket,
From the blanket to the shore,
From the shore to the water
Guess there isn't any more.

## Poetry

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43768/my-last-duchess

That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus.

## Mirrors & Reflections

very morning, the Evil Queen asked the Magic Mirror the question "Magic mirror in my hand, who is the fairest in the land?". The mirror always replies: "My Queen, you are the fairest in the land."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mirror_(Snow_White)#Fairy_tale

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)

> According to Tzetzes, he rejected all romantic advances, eventually falling in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, staring at it for the remainder of his life

<summary>Observations</summary>

## 2021-09-28

Sometime around 1998 when she was around 12 or 13,  my eldest daughter asked if she could have some high heel shoes and lipstick.

This request took me by surprise. I had no idea that she might have a boyfriend or had any romantic interests of any sort at hand.

Some time later (male brains may take a while), it dawned on me that there was no actual romantic interest spurring the request. I now believe that what my daughter wanted to do was to look or appear more like an adult. She wanted to see and fantasize what she might look like at some future time.

* Young girls want to look older
* Older women want to look younger
* Who is on the cover of a man's magazine? A woman
* Who is on the cover of a woman's magazine? A woman
* Who do you look at first when you walk into a room?
* Who was the first person that loved you (and any other infant of either sex)?
* Most likely a woman
* Who was that woman?
* Most likely your mother - a young woman of child bearing age

My thesis: With many humans, there may be some kind of imprinting that accords a particular importance to the views of women of child-bearing age.

The outcome is that most humans like - and may prefer - to look at women of child bearing age. A cause for this behavior may some kind imprinting process that continues to reside in the human genome.

It is critical to note that the gaze described here is not at the same gaze that occurs during the process of sexual selection.

* The gaze as it relates to sexual selection is the one most commonly referred to.
* The two modes of gazing may occur together or separately
* The two modes are most equitable where the young imprint on the female and and the female selects the male on the basis of attraction. Birds are an example.
* In the case of the human species both imprinting and sexual selection focus on the female.


Imprinting

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)

> imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive learning (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behaviour. It was first used to describe situations in which an animal or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is therefore said to be "imprinted" onto the subject.


Sexual Selection

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection

> Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection in which members of one biological sex choose mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better reproductive success than others within a population, either because they are more attractive or prefer more attractive partners to produce offspring.

Projects / Thought experiments

_How would one go about measuring or quantifying the thesis?_

* Compare the percentage of space devoted to images of either sex in advertising and other media
* Note the duration of looks in mirrors before known selections of participants enter rooms having previously been informed of the type of people they can expect to see in the room. Example might include rooms of
	* Eligible young bachelors of one sex or the other
	* 'Attractive' or 'unattractive' people
	* Young people or old people
