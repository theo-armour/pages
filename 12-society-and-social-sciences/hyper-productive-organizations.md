## Preface

This document is an outline of a:

*   [Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto)
*   [game plan](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/game%20plan),
*   [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution),
*   [Rules of engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_engagement),
*   [Rules of order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure),
*   [Recipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe),
*   [Code of conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct)
*   [Code of behavior](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/code+of+behavior),
*   Compact. Compact as used in politics may refer broadly to a pact or treaty
*   Whatever.

**The above is a non-exhaustive list of the ways that people agree to cooperate to accomplish a mission**

What are the behavior patterns that could and should apply to a creative, purposeful and collaborative intellectual endeavor - an endeavor that intends to add lots of cool things to the body of world knowledge?

This is a draft prepared by a single individual. If the work is to be true to its mission then others must join in.

\*\*

Patterns that have come to mind while this document is being written:

This sort of thinking may lend itself to thinking in terms of triads.

As in you can do things fast, well or cheaply. Pick just two.

A web page has content, style and behavior (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

Architecture should be firm commodious and delightful. This revision of the paper suggests that the endeavor should be accessible, usable and delightful

## Mission Statement

The goal of this endeavor is to help small groups of people to accomplish amazing goal or projects.

The methods to achieve this purpose should be 1. accessible, 2. useful and 3. delightful.

**See 'firmness, commodity and delight' or 'firm, commodious and delightful'**

## 1\. Accessible

### Context / Nature of the Problem

*   Research data is lost.
*   People can't be found or are left off lists
*   Reference works cannot be legally copied
*   People are not in the same time zone
*   The distance between people is very great
*   Person A does not know what Person B is doing.
*   People need help completing projects.
*   Emails get lost.
    *   Email threads are inaccessible to non-recipients
*   Significant message threads from the past cannot be reconstituted
*   Meetings are held, things are decided and nobody takes notes

### Objectives

The work product of the endeavor should be accessible to all members. And it should be:

*   Free as in beer - little or no monetary cost to access
*   Free as in liberty - Creative Commons license - do what you want with the data
*   Free as in ticket - location/ distance is not an issue - ubiquitous availability implies global asynchronous Internet availability. Anybody in the world - members of the project and members of the public at-large - has access
*   Free as in time - asynchronous communication - no need for face to face - synchronicity is not an issue
*   Free as in Get-out-of-jail-free - make changes, hack and fiddle without punishment

### Solutions/Tools

And the methods used should be dripping with free, open source technology and/or whatever tools or stuff helps get things done.

The endeavor multiples its productivity by using its awareness, documentation and implementation of the various abilities to multiply productivity.

Email Mailing List

The essential communication is carried out via an email mailing list.

The value of an email mailing list includes:

*   Data is publicly accessible
*   Data including attachments - can last for a long time / forever
*   Users can choose how and when to receive messages
*   User fallibilities are mitigated
*   Admins can control access. stop spamming and trolling

Normal email traffic has **none** of these benefits

See

*   GitHub issues
*   Google Groups
*   Slack

Other communications tools to use include

*   SMS, IRC, Tweets: as required

#### Online Document Repository

Repository for papers and documents that the endeavor is working on and 'owns'  
Could be DropBox, Google Docs or Evernote or another.  
Curated/Deep links to Essential Texts  
The Alexandria Library of the future. Deep links into Google books.

GitHub offers

*   Multiple owners
*   Very large data repositries
*   Project management
*   Revision Control systems

#### collaboration

#### open license

*   Open Licensing

### Comment

The average endeavor in 2013 uses email, transfers documents electronically and may even share a calendar.

A fully-performing in terms of technology endeavor runs circles around the average endeavor in terms of speed. manpower and quality.

Trying to explain to one of the types the vagaries of the other type is beyond my skill set.

In the fully performing endeavour everybody can know anything about the organization in seconds. The knowledge of the organization is accessible to all. And all have the opportunity to add and ameliorate the knowledge. This is second nature to the participants. This is all regardless of time or location. If an unfamiliar technology is required for some aspect, the participants acquire the skill set to operate the new tool in a matter of days.

Preserving knowledge is the enemy. It's about growing knowledge, making it self-repairing, allowing it to plant seeds.

It's about performing the knowledge. The knowledge is the script. But much of what we understand about that script can only be understood when the script is performed.

Knowledge is the DNA. Reality is the baby.

## 2\. Useful

### Context / Nature of the Problem

Much that people do is not particularly productive - watching TV comes to mind.  
Stuff one has learned, books one has read are so easy to forget. Doing hard things well takes lots of practice. People mindlessly repeat. People don't actually listen to each other. People don't end up building a common collective agreed understanding. People leave stuff unfinished. There's never enough time. Or people finish stuff but then it breaks. Keeping track of things is not easy.

The essence is: How to get a really complicated thing done that needs help from a lot of people - and it must be done in a matter of weeks?

Can a philosophical thought alter a significant number of people's daily behavior? The thing is a prisoner of the educated or moneyed classes? if you look at it from a certain point of view, it makes no sense.

### Objectives

Collectively Produced Documents / Instruments - Examples US Constitution, the periodic table of elements, Wikipedia, the Linux operating system, Google Seach results, ISO/W3C standards, Differential Calculus, the layout of the controls in a car, lawyers and legal systems.

Ongoing editions, collectively edited ( not just peer reviewed but peer-written )

If an endeavor is to make a difference, then what it accomplishes must be useful and make a measurable difference in people's lives.

The topic covers so much, it should be of assistance across disciplines.

The endeavor should towards usability. With hope, at least a little of the work product of the endeavor useful to almost anybody  
by the ultra-erudite  
by the texting teen  
by ordinary people tools in order to help decide stuff

### Solutions/Tools

There are two use cases

*   usability for members of the endeavor
*   usability for members of the public

For both of you there should be useful outcomes including the following thoughts:

*   There are ways of doing things - based on templates, cheat sheets or 'jigs'
*   There is project management
*   There are available tasks for a variety of skill sets
*   There is a spreadsheet for this.
*   There is an ontology and handy places to store things
*   There is a glossary, wiki or encyclopedia

And, of course, "There's a method to his madness". The method is not mere repetition but a rehearsal for a leap forward.

### Comments

If, perhaps, the section on accessibility relates to the behavior aspect of a web page ( the JavaScript) then this section refers to the content (HTML) and the following section on style (CSS).

The content should be as if it were part of your brain but kept/stored/safeguarded outside of your brain until it is needed. See David Allen, GTD and writing things down.

## 3\. Delightful

### Context / Nature of the Problem

Hard work without reward is not enjoyable. Small endeavors generally have little or no money to offer as reward. The work you do is not recognized, remembered or rewarded. You are not sure about what you should be doing. If you want to do something that is not mindless but mindful, what is the mindful part?The work was done but it was not elegant or satisfying. I ate too fast and I am still hungry.

### Objectives

Doing fun things together

People should be able to satisfy their need to create beautiful, valuable things

Methods beyond money as compensation must be developed

Prodding for value while de-mystifying / opening up the black boxes out of the love, delight of doing so  
de-mystifying  
defining  
adding value is adding meaning

### Solutions/Tools

*   Meet-ups, get-togethers and wonderful parties
*   Make certain that eork is resume-able
    *   People can have assigned tasks
    *   Good works are recorded for posterity.
    *   Interesting work is lauded.
*   People can do stuff and actually receive feedback
*   Members are invited to speak, contribute elsewhere
*   Working on the endeavor is one of your happy places
*   Rituals? Such as dining together? singing?

### Comments

If you divide things up in terms of who, what, when where and why, then this is the why part.  
This is the part about value, warmth, happiness and fulfillment.

On the other hand, this is also the part that says "I will not rest until it is done" or  
"I will give up my theory when you take it out of my cold dead hands."

## FAQ

### Where are the footnotes?

I so want this document to be a thought process that reflects generations of thoughts, many voices and deep reasoning.

### Why can't I find links to such processes? Are our efforts always capricious, and particular?

### What are some examples of people who get it in terms of technology acquisition/appropriation?

Linus Torvalds and his Linux team

Linus Torvalds and his Git team

The creators of virtually all major operating systems

Certain tiny start-ups that drive large complex operations: DropBox, GitHub and Evernote come to mind. Mr.Doob and the team around him

### Should there be a Benevolent Dictators for Life ~ BDFL?

BDFL are good  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life

Decisions are made, executed and reviewed through a collaborative process

When bad stuff happens that's when the BDFL may be very useful  
What are some of the references used to prepare this document?  
I am reminded of Vitruvius' thought that architecture should be graced with firmness, commodity and delight

Also that project management has the following:

resources, tasks, time, budget

And there is some of Christopher Alexander's A Pattern Language

Can't we solve the mind-body thing without all this mumbo-jumbo?  
We are looking at an enigma that has not been responded to with a successful patty-cake (for want of a better term) in thousands of years. If there is a solution it will derive from the efforts of large numbers of people working in many disciplinees. So just as in the endeavors of a large corporation the work must be profitable, auditable and beneficial. Ascertaining whether these conditions are being fulfilled or not is complex. Defining what 'profitable', 'auditable' and 'beneficial' are from the point of view of audiences such as shareholders, local governments, the LGBT and union-registered circus clowns requires jumbo mumbo-jumbo and probably the help of Dumbo.

The rules of order of the endeavor must endeavor to order the rules or rue the ensuing disorder.

\*\*

Banal endeavor, average skill set, unconsidered activity. I'll accept two of these but not three
