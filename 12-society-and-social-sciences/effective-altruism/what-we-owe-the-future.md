### What We Owe the Future by William MacAskill — our obligation to the unborn billions
The Oxford philosopher makes the case for an unseen group whose interests we have neglected

> Though admirable, this book is not without flaws. He does not seriously engage with the question of the human propensity to discount the future

>I’m not sure what sort of work his arguments will stimulate, but I can say with a high degree of confidence that “What We Owe the Future” is a preposterous book.
>
> Mr. MacAskill, who specializes in asking difficult, often unanswerable, questions about the future, shows little curiosity about the plain ones.
>
>Rarely have I read a book by a reputedly important intellectual more replete with highfalutin truisms, cockamamie analogies and complex discussions leading nowhere. Never mind what we owe the future; what does an author owe his readers? In this case, an apology.

## Population ethics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics

>Population ethics is the philosophical study of the ethical problems arising when our actions affect who is born and how many people are born in the future. An important area within population ethics is population axiology, which is "the study of the conditions under which one state of affairs is better than another, when the states of affairs in question may differ over the numbers and the identities of the persons who ever live."
