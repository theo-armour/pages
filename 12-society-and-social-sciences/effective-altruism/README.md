* "The map is not the territory" - Alfred Korzybski
* "The Communist Manifesto and the Communist Party are not the same"
* Current AV companies and AV possibilities are not the same

Similarly, the EA "manifesto" and the EA "organization" are not the same

The manifesto may provide insights into identifying and highlighting altruistic tendencies that provide feel-good moments and naming opportunities for the donors that might be considered problematic by under-served segments of the general population

* Animal sanctuaries serving organic food
* Private schools with few students and huge assets
* Most anything to do with the vast swaths of yachts sitting in marinas

## My thoughts

Effective altruism

Consider the ant and grasshopper - Aesop's fables

The grasshopper has fun but starves in the end
The any lives through the winter but has no fun.

In the real world we need both.

May the effective altruist participate in the occasional hedonism

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy?

Will takes a complex topic (life) and wants to boil it alk down to just a few topics such as amount of happiness or whether life is god or bad.

There's nothing wrong with this, but it misses important aspects of life

* 24 virtues
* Beauty
* Security

Therefore

* A certain amount of EA is required and necessary
* EA by itself is not sufficient to carry the day

### 2022-09-23

Makes mole-hills out of mountains
* Takes big diverse topics and translates them into simplistic formulas
* Where is the beauty, security & joy we desire

Scott Alexander is the best
