Hello fellow Paulies!

**Subject: Letter to SPS Rector and Board**

I am a new member to the group.  

I want to share with this group a letter than a group of fellow alums and I drafted with a list of proposed initiatives that we are urging the school to take regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion. The letter can be accessed here:

https://www.bipocatsps.org/

I would appreciate your support by reading & signing the petition and then sharing it with others within the SPS community.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!

Jose,

Bravo. Thank you so much. I signed with this as a comment:

This is long overdue. I recall as a new 5th former that one of my fellow new classmates, a great girl from the Bronx and of I believe Puerto Rican descent, left after her first semester because she felt so alienated at the school. Diversity enriches experience - although at SPS, it was all too often feared. Many conversations while at the school and as an alum with classmates and faculty of color have confirmed that the school was all the more hard for them because of the attitudes toward minorities. Heck, I got hazed for being of Jewish descent, and I am white and came from an affluent family. I have only been able to imagine what it is like for people whose racial, class and cultural backgrounds are even more different than mine were from the majority at the school. I wholeheartedly support this initiative, have wanted the school to head in this direction for decades. I would think far more highly of the school and the integrity of its focus on service and compassion if such a program were to be implemented with seriousness and skill. I stand ready to help.

Appreciative,

Diane Moss, '85

Jose and Diane M and all:

This is a promising alumni initiative that Mr. Leos is a part of below. And, it is long overdue.

The full throated support of the School will of course only really be demonstrated if the Board and its practices and systems and the people of governance join; not to do what you and others can do well -- but, to change themselves, both individually and institutionally.   

There is a difference between 1) the SPS Board putting on the face and expression of support (or aiding in the distribution  of words) for you and the initiative -- and, 2) the Board changing itself and its commitments to practices that enable the systemic overhauls you are aiding to achieve and describing.   

Recall, the SPS Board has had blacks and people of color on it for what is by now a "long time."  

Did that make a difference?  How?  Maybe.  Maybe it was "quiet difference."  Did  it accelerate the current initiative of Mr. Leos at SPS?  Maybe indirectly, maybe not.  Did it aid in uncovering abuses or facing them? Not exactly. 

I have a kind of equity comment to share that may be hard to hear now, but is intended today without malice -- it is a plain observation:  

SPS Board members (and SPS Board alums) who are black or persons of color have attacked or denied or delayed the things I have done (or just avoided them from their position of fiduciary duty)  from the year 2001 to today.  The School and its form of Board practice for the last 20 to 50 years has not actually brought out the best in people.  Neither did the "Church and its traditions."  ... As we know only too well in the areas you are getting at and in the adult child abuse area (or child on child abuse) where abusers and the abused and the complicit were of all colors and largely devoted to silence.   

By now, and stated gently, some of the people  have come around.  Some are not now here to come around.  

This is stated simply to point out that change, character and courage are not colors.  These things are more like practiced devotions that need to be honed. Especially change.  Change is hard; which is why even very well meaning people (all or any of us for example) find it really hard -- for decades or more.  

The past is with us today at SPS.  But, the way ahead can be about change and thus the past can be meaningfully faced.  It starts with everyone -- including the SPS Board -- being visibly and vocally committed to change -- and committed, in my view, to let go of practices and ways that have not helped.  

Letting go is hard.  Whole books and practices are devoted to the subject.  

In my view, it helps to listen to kind, strong, humble people who are committed to these sorts of things.  Even when it is hard and even at SPS.  SPS has these folks, if it cares to listen in timely, unforced fashion. 

Thank you for your efforts Jose and all.  This should be good.  It can be good.

Dear fellow Paulies,

I disagree strenuously with the assertion that St. Paul’s School is racist, failing to practice what it preaches or to live up to its foundational values. I would not be surprised if some of the students are racist, but that does not make the institution racist. The East Coast society and the Episcopal Church from which the school comes have long been hotbeds of liberalism. That is why Donald Trump hates them so much. Look at how SPS has influenced the world. Look at some of the names that have passed through the place: John Lindsay, John Kerry, Robert Mueller, Garry Trudeau, Bishop John Walker.

So, what is the “culture" that we are told must be changed? What is it about black students that SPS supposedly is asking them to adapt? What does it mean to "deliver equity"? We are directed to review all academic curricula with a perspective of equity and inclusion. How one does that with Euclidean geometry is a puzzle.

Reading through the entries on the Instagram page I note that among matters of concern are many that are of minimal significance or completely irrelevant. The worst instance was perpetrated by a teacher, not a student, and that teacher should have been fired at the time, as encouraging students is a fundamental part of the job.

The school has always catered to students of above average ability. How the school is going to select applicants to fit that in the absence of tests is a mystery. But if it continues that way it can only be inclusive in a very narrow sense.

Let us change what needs to be changed, and not join the frenzy that seeks to smash everything that is within reach. It is an error to think that those three deaths compel us to rethink our whole existence. There are many other deaths. The laws regarding police use of force are defectively drafted. The fact that a substantial number of American police officers are racist is not the fault of St Paul’s School.

I go along with Rory.  To give an example,  the school accepted its first Japanese student in 1947.  This was at a time when many students had fathers who had just come home from the war many of whom had suffered atrocities of the Japanese army and who may have well influenced a lot of their sons to hate all Japanese.  I think that was very forward thinking of the school.  As to how that student fared, I cannot say, but he did stay to graduate and there were many Japanese to follow.  We had Yoshiaki Shimizu  and Toshimichi Hirai when I was there in the early fifties and they were well regarded.

The fact that we have a Japanese chapter of the SPS Alumni Association in Tokyo is a tribute to the forward thinking of the school.
 
As for the school policy towards blacks at that time I would not know.  Did any apply?  I think the school was wise to put a black on the faculty first before giving out scholarships to deserving blacks.
 
The school has tried to be on the front lines when it came to loosening up its student body to include those beyond the Waspy Eastern Establishment as the social  mores among  society in general became more liberal over the years.

José and Diane, Alexis, Rory & Brent

Thank you all for engaging, considered and intentional messages.

In all of this dialog I am reminded of a text we all know:

### The School Payer

_"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."_


What resonates between the School Prayer and "[Letter to SPS rector and board regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion]( https://www.bipocatsps.org/ )" is that both are written in the present tense, demand agency and action, and are expressions of hope. There are no admissions of past guilt. There are no expressions of gratitude for past joys. There is is simply a call to seek outcomes that are equitable for all

Rory, Brent and Alexis: I hear you - and yet you are not as forward looking as the prayer. You discuss a past that I share. In my case, Bishop Walker and my '65 classmate Bob Hall were the first Black people I ever had a dialog with. For sure SPS has been less bad than many. For sure SPS - over the decades - has chosen to lift fingers many times. For sure we mostly did not forget to be kind.

Nonetheless there are still vast swaths of people in this world that have been and are denied the joy, friendship and happiness for which we have all prayed. And many are denied only because of their race.

The thrust in José's text is - like the prayer - forward looking. The text asks the future School to evolve so as to be eager to bear the burdens of others. The text asks that we the members of the School's community create plans for how to be thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves.

I do agree with Rory that there is currently a "frenzy" with much media hype regarding the relations between races. But the call to action for Saint Paul's School is timeless:  

1. Be a leader in racial equity in education - and not to cease until there are million or more schools as good as Saint Paul's
2. Establish metrics, guidelines and practices that help us to measure our failures and improvements
3. Celebrate all our differences and all our similarities


The representation of a pelican piercing its breast to feed its young with its own blood is called a [“Pelican in her Piety”]( http://www.thewestologist.com/symbols/the-symbol-of-self-sacrifice ). We all know this symbol well:

![SPS-logo-2019-fullColor]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/journal/07/SPS-logo-2019-fullColor.png )
 
Now,  I'm not sure José wants us all to pierce our breasts, but I feel he is asking us to remember, to be unselfish and to bear the burdens of others. José, it's a bloody good plan.

All,

To my mind, this talk of racism (not just at the school but throughout society) has missed the mark. Very simply put, to my mind, “racism” is one example of social justice. Especially the way it’s being bandied about, people accusing other people of “racism” often without clear proof and generally just to put the other party on the defensive.

To me the larger issue is “prejudice”, which basically is making decisions about people based on surface and often inaccurate information. In other words, not based on the truth. Prejudice is often…usually…based one one person’s ignoring or denying one of the basic tenets of our great nation, that all people are, because all were created by a loving God, created equal. Everyone deserves to be honored and respected. God created us all. This goes no matter what sex, or age, or form, or economic status. Etc. This is justice founded on the life and word of Christ. Expressed in the Gospels and in many of the letters of Paul (eg. Ephesians).

“Speaking [and acting] the truth in love.” And truth is not always nice. Truth requires courage. Courage based on Biblical, not political or any other kind of biased teachings.

Blessings,

Jim Hart ‘60

Hi Jim

There are many truths in your message. It is hard to imagine a superior being acting on any universal principle other than random chance and the luck of the draw. We would not want fickle or temperamental gods (in the modern era anyway).  Therefore, yes, "Everyone deserves to be honored and respected". And, fingers crossed, the desire for theocracies based on groups of "chosen" people are fading.  

## Humans are capricious

Wait, there's more. Down here we human creatures seem to play a different game. We do play favorites, pick sides and place bets. As a result the outcomes here on earth are not so random. Some peeps get more than others.

I am not Black. I cannot speak for Black people. I cannot even begin to say that I control my biases.

But I can observe situations

* When the ship is sinking, the outcry is "women and children first"
* As you walk into a public building you may observe the ramp for access by wheelchair
* After the Holocaust, the state of Israel came to be in much part because of the Holocaust 
* The Geneva convention demands humane treatment of your deadly enemy
* The Marshall plan produced and sent goods and services from the Unites States to the enemies recently defeated

The world really does have a history of following the call in our School Prayer about being "eager to bear the burdens of others" and also being selective about whose burdens are worth bearing.

We humans are capricious. We identify underdogs. We try to help. 

## Racism is everywhere

Here is another observation. After the Second World War, Aneurin Bevin, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan Minister of Health in England led the strategy that enable the the British National Health Service in 1946 - leading to a system of medical that serves all-comers in the UK. At the same time Walter Reuther  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther - as President of the United Automobile Workers Union - was part of the effort that made health care in the United States the responsibility of private employers - such as GM, Ford and Chrysler and unlike the rest of the world not a government obligation. Why? Because a national plan would have to include Black people. An employer-based plan could be tailored to fit the white union-members and exclude Black people. I do not have a good link to the Reuther involvement - and later he gets involved with Civil Rights and does favor a national plan so it get complicated. But here are links to articles on racism in US medicine of that era: 

* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/universal-health-care-racism.html
* https://ssa.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/JHSB04ExtraQuadagno.pdf
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447696/

There is health injustice in the United States with respect to Black people, indigenous people and people of color. The injustice in endemic, pervasive and total. The injustice is exacerbated by the current pandemic.

Health injustice is but one of the injustices that Black people live with.

## Uncle Edmund pays with his life

But let us come back to our School. Just look at life - and healthcare - from another perspective. In 1912, my great uncle Edmund as a first former at the School became ill and died of polio. My great-grandfather said that this should never happen again and donated the funds to build what was then called the Armour Infirmary. In my era we called it "The Cooler". I nearly died there myself in my first firm year of pneumonia. The thing is that for a number of years the Infirmary was the best hospital in New Hampshire. I don't think this was unusual. Everything about the school oozes being the best. Whatever happens, there are and have always been people that lift their fingers and write checks.

## Give light to all in the house

Is this merely the best school money could buy? Is that it? I want to think that there is more. I want to say to Saint Paul's School of Concord NH:

"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."—Jesus, from the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5:14-16.

A light is needed. We don't always see clearly. My guess is that most German people in Germany in WWII were not really cognizant that the Holocaust was happening. I think that there are a good number of people in a America who are not aware of the racial injustice that occurs in our country here and now .

The call to action by José Leos is to let the light shine. Not just in the Chapel and not just in the hockey rink. But to schools everywhere. Put the light "on a stand", and keep it dright until "it gives light to all in the house".For example: let a light shine on good practices that teachers feel are pedagogically informative in manifesting our racial biases. Let a light shine on usable metrics that heads of schools and school boards can use to identify bad and good racism-revealing practices. And provide head-lamps to students in learning pods that help enlighten their "spidey-sense" about a situation being valid.

I don't know how. I don't know where. But I hope that the "Letter to SPS rector and board regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion" shines a light to all in the house - and more. 

## Your candles shine as bright as my candle

Thinking about the process of enlightenment, reminds me of another useful quote.

“He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” —Thomas Jeferson https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson

Our tapers may be the finest, most expensive tapers there are. Not to worry. Your tapers - no matter how humble - once lit may shine a light as just bright as ours. And more to the point, our collaboration did not cost me a penny.

For sure, Saint Paul's School is a "city on the hill". Now step back a bit. Note that there are other hills out there. Would it mot be totally cool to see lights on all those hills?

Now I don't care how many billionaire parents there are out there, bu there are not enough to put tapers on all the hills. And asking you to be "eager to bear the burden of others" should not send you to the poor house.

There is a simpler, faster, cheaper way: Just share the skills, techniques, lessons-learned and insights on how to make the tapers. 

In the context of this email thread, that means taking the workflow that José Leos proposes and actively sharing the processes with the other side of Pleasant Street in Concord (which includes Concord High ) and with all comers - via people, papers and programs - on all the hills everywhere.


And in doing so, let the bearing the burden of others become a piece of cake.

Hi Jim
This is a very long and convoluted reply - and could use editing and clarification - sorry for this. But I hope it begins to address the notion that what José Leos proposes is more than bearing the burden of others. It may also be able add a new-found joy.
