Getting Paid for Open Source Work

Sustain your work in open source by getting financial support for your time or your project.

There are at least two aspects to making some money with open source software development:

The first is becoming visible to communities who would be willing to pay you for your efforts
The second is the growing of communities that have the resources to pay you

# Becoming Visible
An artist creates a painting. Somebody buys the painting.
An author writes a story. Somebody publishes it.

Selling work product is very old stuff. And yet the process keeps getting more sophisticated and there are more opportunities to check out the work prior to making a decision.

Today a graphic designer shows a web page of logos with links to the customers sites. Clents can

A musician builds a web page with links to the songs they have recorded

Similar things are happening with code.

In the old days the code you wrote was hidden in some inaccessible proprietary binary file.

Today the situation for programmers has improved because of open source.

Anecdotally, in my field of 3D and WebGL, I know that [Brandon Jones]( https://github.com/toji ) was hired by Google because of his [gl-matrix]( https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix ) library. [Aki Rodic]( https://github.com/arodic ) (now in Shanghai ) was first hired by Google because of his [jellyfish]( http://arodic.github.io/p/jellyfish/ ) script.

Of course, you cannot see the code they wrote thats embedded in proprietary apps, but increasing numbers of peeps have contributions visible in open source efforts.


# Resourceful Communities

Let's look at some actual numbers.

These days we can look at the contributions of millions of programers. The GitHub API is one of several great resources for this work.

My current tool is [GubGub]( https://pushme-pullyou.github.io/gubgub/r2/index.html ) is a very work-in-progress script that uses the GitHub API to find interesting things in public, open-source repositories. The default search identifies the top 100 repositories with the most stars.

The list is displayed in the 'Select GitHub user and repo' in the side menu.

* Spinoff projects from established companies - Bootstrap, React, Angular
* Independent projects that grew into communities and started getting support - D3, jQuery, FontAwesome
* Projects maintained by individuals that are funded in a variety of ways - Linux, Animate.css, Three.js

There are also an increasing number of teaching or support projects where students are encouraged to star projects as part of the lesson plan.

All of these projects are large enough that they employ people or people are employed because of their good skill and knowledge in using the project.

None or almost none of these projects were directly funded by VCs or angels.

There is a good mix of corporate spinoff off projects and individual hacker projects.

Even smaller projects have dozens of contributors. At the top there's room for many people.

There's nobody gunning for an IPO here. There are no Zuckerbergs, Bezos, Jobs or Gates here. Just large communities of moderately prosperous people doing nice, constructive things in a collaborative ways.

Conclusions

There are two way of making money:

Contribute to large projects and become good enough so that people pay you.

Start something new by yourself or with a few people and grow it until enough people benefit from your work so they want to pay for more development and support.

The really fun thing is doing a bit of both - helping others and using what you learn to start new efforts.
