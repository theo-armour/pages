# Successful Family

## Definitions

Success is the state or condition of meeting a defined range of expectations. It may be viewed as the opposite of failure.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success_(concept)

The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community

## Mission ~ what we can do now

We establish ways of communicating that go beyond small talk and lead to more discussions leading to making agreed agreeable decisions

## Vision ~ of the future

We "belong" to a group of people that

* maintains deep commitments, trust and unconditional love
* shares values, possessions and recipes & jokes
* seeks strong achievements, engaging activities and service to others
* lives in beauty, love and kindness
* in times of plenty and in times of adversity
* in places far from each other almost all the time

## 2020-10-10 ~ First pass: A cursory examination on the components that make for a successful family

This is a first pass at setting down thoughts and observations that respond to questions that I have been carrying around in my head for a while. Examples include:

* What are my duties, commitments and obligations to my family?
* What should I want or expect from my family and as I age?
* What is a family all about now that I am old and single?
* Who are the people I should consider to be in my family?
* What interactivity, intimacy, privacy should I offer and receive?
* And, now that I am trying to design my after life, what is my legacy to my family?

In my brain I mushed all these together under the rubric "What is a successful family?" and then used this phrase to search for articles using Google.

Skimming the links provided below, my first take: good communication between members of the family is an essential component - if not *the* essential element of a successful family.

Less clearly defined is the nature of the communication. Given the nature of the other components listed, it seems likely that the communication is based on discussion that leads to agreements in coming to a variety of decisions.

From my questions and from my - as usual - fast but shallow reading I have written the "demo" mission and vision statements.

	* communication
	* encouragement of individuals
	* commitment to family
	* religious orientation

	* ability to adapt
	* expressing appreciation

Definitions of a successful family ~ copied from the article

* One criterion for a successful family is that it is able to reproduce itself; i.e. to raise children who go on to establish stable and harmonious families themselves.
* a family is successful to the extent that it provides an environment appropriate for the development of child and parent alike.
* a successful or strong family "creates a sense of positive family identity, promotes satisfying and fulfilling interaction among members, encourages the development of family group and individual members, and is able to deal with stress"
* 1) "cope with stress and problems in an efficient and effective way;" 2) "have and use coping resources both from within and from outside the family;" and 3) "have the ability to end up being more cohesive, more flexible and more satisfied as a result of effectively overcoming stress and problems"

Two important unanswered questions

1. Are family strengths causative, or merely symptomatic?
2. How transferable are "family strengths" to families that are not functioning well?
