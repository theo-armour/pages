## Alcohol Addiction

In dose–response analyses, moderate drinking up to 40 g/day was associated with a lower risk of dementia when compared with lif-time abstaining.

### Conclusions
Abstinence from alcohol appears to be associated with an increased risk for all-cause dementia. Among current drinkers, there appears to be no consistent evidence to suggest that the amount of alcohol consumed in later life is associated with dementia risk.

## Standard Drink

1 oz = 29.5735 ml

### National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism / https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/

In the United States, one "standard" drink (or one alcoholic drink equivalent) contains roughly 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in:
* 12 ounces or 355 ml of regular beer, which is usually about 5% alcohol = 17.75 grams
* 5 ounces of wine, which is typically about 12% alcohol ~ 5 oz @ 13.5 = 20 gm ~ 6 * 29.6 * 0.135 = 24 grams!!
* 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, which is about 40% alcohol ~ 45 * 0.4 = 18 gm

In reality one standard drink may be closer to 20 grams than to 14 grams
