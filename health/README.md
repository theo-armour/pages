A morning visit: Dominique's head was not turned to the side as it was last night. She faced directly out from the pillows and seemed more calm.

A calm sleep is very dependent on a good amount of oxygen reaching. Her breath is quite clear. There are no raspiness or gurgling noises. She is, however, breathing with her mouth open. Breathing through the mouth eases the intake of oxygen.

Last night, when I held her hand and gave a squeeze, there was no response. I have been reading about the end of life. It seems that people who are outwardly and physically unresponsive may still be aware and able to hear - hearing is one of the last senses to lapse before death.

So looking at Dominique, I feel she is still here with us yet fading quietly and gently


***

Dominiqua Gaspar died at 5:25 pm.

After dinner, I read the message from Edina. I went down and sat next to Dominique's bed. Mostly I looked at her face - just slightly gaunt and gray. I put my hand on her knee. Even through the blanket, her knee was still warm. A few times I sang the "Tender Shepherd" lullaby to her. Mostly I looked at her face and my mind's eye flashed on images of her from the past few months.

I talked with Roxanna, Dominique's caregiver. She said that Dominique slipped away calmly. Edina and Flora were both there.

Goodbye Dominique. You have left me a legacy replete with the twists and turns of friendly new connections in my life. Thank you.

The Next Rules of Work: The Mindset, Skillset and Toolset to Lead Your Organization through Uncertainty Paperback â€“ August 31, 2021
by Gary A. Bolles

>Organizations, managers and workers still have an Industrial Era mindset towards work. How can leaders guide individuals and organizations to solve the increasingly complex work challenges of tomorrow?

>As traditional jobs give way to new work roles and software and robots perform the repetitive tasks formerly done by humans, the work of today is no longer guaranteed to be here tomorrow. The Next Rules of Work helps leaders understand why traditional notions about work inhibit the organization's ability to address new problems and how they can successfully equip their organizations to manage constant change. By first developing a new mindset to help themselves and their teams become more agile, leaders can then co-create the organization's "next mindset" by answering five key questions that help them establish constantly adaptive strategies. Finally, leaders develop agile learning practices to ensure that workers will continually have the skillsets and toolsets they need to solve organizational problems today.

>By redefining the fundamental nature of work, teams and the organization, The Next Rules of Work goes beyond offering advice and predictions and provides organizational leaders with a guide to create truly agile organizations that can respond to perpetual change.
