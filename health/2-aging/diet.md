# Diet

## Concept

* Establish guidelines for a healthy, sustainable and tasty meal plan
* Within the Heritage schema
* Works in my seventies. For a few years if nothing else changes much. Redesign when there are changes


## Things to consider

* Reporting and monitoring?
* Sustainability?
* Beauty?
* Role in socialization?

## My rules

Breakfast

* Eat mixed fruit - berries and melons - every day for breakfast.
	* Prunes and prune juice as and when needed
* 7 eggs per week maximum
* No bacon or deli meats - ie avoid dishes with high concentrations of nitrites or celery
* Patty sausage preferred over sausage links

Lunch and dinner

* 3 lunch items max
* 4 dinner items max
* Two half portions count as one is sort of OK
* Eat all soups
* Eat all salads
* 3 fish dishes per week minimum
	* When fish is a main course option, choose the fish over the meat
* Greens preferred over root
	* Above ground veggies over below ground
* Occasional walnuts, yoghurt, cheese of fruit

Things to avoid

* No rolls, bread, buns or biscuits
	* Skip them on hotdogs, hamburgers and sausages as well
	* Skip the pancakes, waffles and French toast
* No starches ~ potato, white rice, pasta
* No desserts ~ except for chocolate, cheesecake, flan and poached pear desserts


Salad dressings and condiments

* Normally accept the dressing what chef supplies
* Olive oil and vinegar as preferred salad dressing when asked to choose
* Skip the butter, ketchup, maple syrup, honey and marmalade
* Add pepper or sriracha as desired
* No added salt
* No added sugar

y
Drinks
* 4 to 5 coffees per day
* 4 to 5 other glasses of liquids a day
* 7 to 14 glasses of wine or beers per week
* Two or three glasses wine or beer in a day max
* Occasional V8, ice tea, Arnold Palmer, cranberry juice

In the rare instance when comfort food is needed over the menu selection

* One or two times per month max
* Egg salad with avocado on rye
* Grilled cheese on whole wheat
* Ham and cheese on rye
* Fish dish - usually grilled basa with tarter sauce

Calcium

* Cheese in scrambled eggs
* Occasional yoghurt and cheese
* Occasional nuts

Fiber

* Supplement with one cup of Kellogg's Bran Buds every evening

Supplements

* 1000 IU Vitamin D3 every day

## Schedules

* Eat three meals a day - in the dining room
* No cooking or snacks
	* Except fiber
* Take the stairs
* Wash hands and brush teeth after


## Judgments or rules

* Dining is a social experience
* Different metabolisms need different rules
	* Me: able to gain a kilo in a day. Cannot lose much more than 0.2 kilos a day. The latter needs good control.
	* There a great meal may need five days of great control to take off
* Skip one or two meals a week may be a good thing?
* Eat what is on the main menu as much as possible
* Eat the daily dishes
	* Greater variety of micro-nutrients
	* Increased variety of taste sensations

## Wondering

* Enough? One mixed fruit, two soups, two salads, one veggie side dish provides a sufficient daily dose of veggies?
* More calcium?

Maybe a coach is not needed. Heritage food is a well designed, highly consistent process. Once a successful pattern is established for an individual it only needs to be tweaked occasionally. An annual checkup with a dietician might be all that is necessary.
