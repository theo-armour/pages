I am not a statistician. nonetheless I can think out loud. 

Let us say that your chance or probability of catching the covid-19 virus is X.

if you live by yourself, then the chance of you catching the virus at home is X

if you live with another person then they may catch the virus and give it to you. Therefore your chance of getting the virus is to X.

if there are two other people living in your establishment. then there are three people living together and you might think that your chances of getting the virus are 3x.

but one of the other residents may pass the virus on to the other person who winter and passes it on to you. they're for the three of you have a chance that is 3 factorial or 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.

if you live with three other people then the probability is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 or 24X.

the rates are transmission between people and the timing and duration of proximity and whatever are far more complex than these numbers indicate.  

if you live in a group home and one of the members catches the virus and you are all in Fairly good contact with each other then the probability that you will catch the virus goes through the roof.

if you live by yourself and are fairly careful when you go out then you should be okay.

if you live with others then you must, must be extra vigilant.
