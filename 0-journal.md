### AI AEC ~ First curated collection

My first curated Raindrop share

* https://raindrop.io/TheoA/ai-aec-35784921
* Appears both in Pages and Raindrop
* Pages Read me and Raindrop Share link to each other

Want
* Every Raindrop collection to have a Pages Read Me in the equivalent Pages folder
* Every Pages folder to have a Raindrop Share link in the equivalent Raindrop collection

Questions
* Where to keep notes and indication as as to best links to look at in the category


### Combine with Raindrop.io

Raindrop.io is a bookmarking service that syncs across devices. It is a great way to save and organize links to web pages, videos, images and other content.

It is not open source, but has good export and import features.

I seem to be a hoarder of bits and pieces of knowledge. Some bit are note some bits are bookmarks. For decades they have been to separate structures/domains in my life - left brain and right brain? - may it's time to co-mingle some aspects. I have started this already by using the same Wikipedia catalog structure.

What I have been doing is bring bookmarks into my Pages pages. This requires a lot of effort and allows for processing only a few links at a time.

Raindrops facilitates drag and drop, adding notes, re-titling and more. Other benefits include the ability to share collections of links with others.

### Setting up titling standard to help with sorting

set domain url as first item in in the title order tp facilitate sorting in alphabetical order
