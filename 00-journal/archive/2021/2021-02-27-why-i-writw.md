# Why I write
**in response to Eleanor Bissell's "Why I write"**

* So as to be able to forget
* To not have to remember too much
* To get "it" out of my brain
* To enable my future self to dialog with my past self
* To explain things more clearly than the muddle that floats in the brain
* To combine bunches of thought-ettes into coherent wholes
* To help others see or feel things more clearly
* To have fun with words - and the five senses
* To record puns and word games and word oddities - watchstrap - bookkeeper - sequioa
* To let people know that I love them
* To create at least ten bullet points
* To create useful instructions to help people do something better
* To provide feedback or commentary on something I have observed
* To describe something that does not exist yet but could
* To specify the design of something
* To help me decide if I like or dislike the thing thing I am thinking about
* To help me decide
* To describe a problem or an issue in such a way that it can be made possibly solvable
* To discuss the pros and cons of something with myself
* To create manifestos
* To add to "To Do" and "Done" lists
* To help the people of the future know a little bit about me
* To make something now that can be improved upon tomorrow
* To create new new thoughts
* To tell a story
* To make a laugh
* To figure out the feelings
* To have something to edit
* To create an agenda
* To help to start things and to finish things
* To have something that can be agreed
* To have something to talk about
* To track what happened
* To reveal bias
* To reveal whim and whimsy
* To disagree gently or vehemently according to the situation
* To help you sing
* To explore the art of punctuation; whetever!
* To sum things up
* To live in the moment - with no rhyme or reason but letting the moment be recorded somehow right now
* To know that it matters that I live
