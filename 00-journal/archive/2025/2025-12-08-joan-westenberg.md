My thoughts from long ago still hold up.

It may be more interesting to be a gifted amateur than to be a professional.

Being a professional means you have to specialize. You have to pick a niche and stick to it. You have to learn the rules of the game and play by them. You have to conform to the expectations of your peers and your audience.
Being a gifted amateur means you can explore many different fields and interests. You can learn from various disciplines and combine them in unique ways. You can challenge the status quo and innovate. You can follow your curiosity and passion without being constrained by the need to conform.
