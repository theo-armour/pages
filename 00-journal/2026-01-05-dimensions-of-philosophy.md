# 2026-01-05 Dimensions of Philosophy

## 3x3 grid of philosophy dimensions
* Three triads
* Column 1: Doing, Knowing, Being
* Column 2: Mission, Values, Vision
* Column 3: Sign, Signifier, Signified
* Row 1: External world
* Row 2: Internal world
* Row 3: Self-reflection

## Thinking

* Column 3 may do better as what the rows represent, but then what does column three show?
* What do the rows represent? Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness?? ;-)
* So there are nine box types and one row and one column type for eleven contexts to think about.
* Rows, columns and boxes can be updated by you. It's all a WIP
