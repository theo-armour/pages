# 2026-01-11 Beauty = psychological richness

I'm just drafting an addendum to my post on Savon de Marseille. I want to say why I like it, so that made me think of a triad: we want something that is meaningful, pleasurable, and beautiful.
As I was coming up with this idea, the question of beauty came up - this mysterious thing that we seem to want, animals and people and everything. That complexity factor made me think: "Beauty is the same sort of thing as psychological richness."

The triad of life is then:
1. Hedonism
2. Eudaimonia
3. Kallos (beauty in Greek)
