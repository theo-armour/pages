# Surfing Up A Three Meter Wave

## My response to a comment about a new techie device I found interesting

The following article is written from the perspective of a 76-year-old white man who is a partil-paraplegic with an amputated left hand. In other words, I will never operate the device I write about below. On the other hand, my disabilities may have brought sa consciousness of muscules, abilities, balance, poise anf more that is beyounf what most people require to live their daily lives.

I recently had an online dialog about an electric surfboard. Please Click on the link below to see what I plan to discuss.

Theo:

When I see shipping products like this, I know we are living in the future: https://fliteboard.com/

Cynthia:

These are so weird to me I don't get it. I mean I get it but I have zero interest

I do feel or grasp where Cynthia is coming from. After all, you will never ever see me riding upon one of these devices. Nonetheless:

## I Have Infinite Zero Interest

On the other hand - not that I have one, one may have great interest even though one may have zero interest. I have no interest because, after all, I cannot think of any rational purpose of even thinking of getting my aged carcass on one of these devices. ;-)  Nonetheless, I believe the "thought experiment"  on "Fliteboard" is of interest.

## For me, the word "Future" is unrealistically important

When I talk about "living in the future" ( sometimes referred to as "Theo's dream utopia" ), there are some unspoken but specific ideals - see also "Rules of Road Runner....

The dream utopia rules may include the following:

The idea works as advertised

The idea is beneficial to one and all

The idea may not cause any bad things to happen

Some aspect of security or beauty is inferable

In other words, the idea is examined in its ideal, perfect, and wonderful world. After all, if the idea cannot be seen to be satisfying in a perfect world, then it may be likely to have aspects that might suck in the real world.

## Dreaming of the Possibility of New Freedoms or Liberties

_So tell me what you want, what you really, really want._ Spice Girls

Thought 1: Freedom of speech and the pursuit of happiness are great freedoms. There are, moreover, other freedoms we discuss much less frequently.  Not to be forgotten: the primal animal freedom is to move body parts at liberty in 3D space. Animals are better at moving than plants and rocks. An animal that can move freely is happier than a stuck animal.

Thought 2: Little flashes of happiness happen so frequently in modern life that we too often let these moments pass by without registering them.

OK, this is debatable, but bear with me. Moments of happiness that are readily attainable may include physicality - dancing, playing tennis, practicing making babies, whatever. In other words a good move brings a flash of joy.

In recent times we have enlarged the range of available 3D physicality. Some times by better traing. Sometimes by new or improved equipment. Gymnasts and figure skaters perform moves impossible to previous generations. When you include new technology, human physicality attains new freedoms. Skis & snowboards, goggles & flippers, mountain bikes & skateboards enable movement in 3D space that eviscerate gravity.  There is joy in three-dimensional liberty.

So what about Fliteboard?

## Wave to the Beauty

My simple vision is of a human body riding on one of these devices. The body is slithering hips, undulating shoulders and twisting torso in such ways as to rule the waves by waiving the rules.

Have you skied through deep powder down a mountain slope? Have you felt your body engaging yet freeing itself from the terrain beneath? Have you put on goggles and flippers, dived down a depth and contorted your body in ways n dry land?

Today's surfboard riders perform can perform sublime moves - bit in an experience that last just a small number of seconds. What moves can be generated when you can surf for numbers of minutes

If so, can you imagine how your body might feel about surfing up a five-meter wave?
