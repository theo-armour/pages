# 2022-12-06 Notes, Catalogs and Tags

I have been taking notes for something like sixty years.

10 notes of 10 words for 365 days for 60 years = 2,190,000 words.

Of course, the majority of these notes of mine are lost. But even if they were not lost there's even a bigger dilemma. How to make some sense of all the thoughts? How to relate my thoughts to all the other possible thoughts out there?

And it's more about mere "thoughts", it's about:

* the thousands of links that I have "bookmarked"
* All the people and organizations that I know things about
* The events and "happenings" of a good life
* And for good measure we can add health records, investments, statements all that other type of good stuff that's floating around my hard disks.

And even trickier, some stuff may be private to me and some may want to be open to share with the world or just a few.

I want to take all this huge, complex and fascinating pile of stuff and make it all available in a way that is simple, simple, simple

I have thought about this thought for decades. What would be a good way to catalog my thoughts so that they would be:

* Organized ~ every new note has a logical storage location
* Retrievable ~ groups of related thoughts can be found easily
* Shareable ~ people other than me may access my thoughts now and in the future

Each of these objectives has taken up many hours of my thoughts and efforts.

After years of losing thoughts irretrievably embedded in proprietary data files, I now keep everything in plain text files using the Markdown format. For editing I am using VS Code which allows for collaboration, revision control and much more.

In recent years, the Internet has come to provide many technical solutions for retrieval and sharing. Storing data in the cloud and search engines are coming to the rescue.

But *organizing* thoughts goes far beyond what is technically doable. It seeks an "ontology" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology - how entities are grouped into categories.

Over the decades, systems I have investigated include:

Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress, Dublin Core, Applied Category Theory, Folksonomy, the Yahoo Directory as well and may home brew schemes.

All have come to naught for typical reasons:

* Any system that uses numbers takes too much thinking
* Any homebrew system is not easily shareable
* Any system that is not in some way intuitive is no fun

In recent years, I have come to understand that we want both categories and tags.

* Categories ~ the classic "tree" of folders and files ~ a file drawer for every file
* Tags ~ embedded keywords that and "meta" aspects to the thoughts

Tags are easy-peasy. Any word can be a tag. Tags can be added and edited at any time. There's no limit to the number of tags. And so on

Establishing a cataloging system is the tricky one. Of course, one starts with a hoe brew system: with folders with titles such as "work","home", "books", "ski resorts", "recipes" and so on. It works in the beginning but then when you end up with folders such as 17th century watches from Spain", "new world truffles" and "Fruits of South East Asia" things get tricky. So then you look at what libraries do and you pick on Dewey Decimal and Library of congress cataloging systems.

What happens then is that you end up spending more time looking for the right catalog number then you you spend on creating the thought.

Recently the light bulb in my brain turned on. I've been using the catalog system of my dreams for years already. I've even been a donor to the cause. Follow the Wikipedia Catalog system!

At the bottom of virtually every Wikipedia there is a section called "categories" which lists one or more categories that the authors of the article consider relevant. Every listed category is part of a huge tree of categories. The tree covers millions of articles edited over the decades. The overall structure of the tree of Wikipedia categories appears to be quite rational and well worked out. Even if there are issues, it is a system that that is accessible, comprehensive and moderately intuitive.

Did you know that all human knowledge can be put into just thirteen categories? Here they are:

* General reference
* Culture and the arts
* Geography and places
* Health and fitness
* History and events
* Human activities
* Mathematics and logic
* Natural and physical sciences
* People and self
* Philosophy and thinking
* Religion and belief systems
* Society and social sciences
* Technology and applied sciences

Wikipedia provides extensive writing on categories
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents/Categories

As of this writing, I am well into the process of moving my note files into folders titled according to Wikipedia Categories

* It helps being quite familiar with Wikipedia and how it is organized and maintained
* It helps to have a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Wikipedia
* In Wikipedia articles can be in multiple categories, but original files can only be in one folder so deciding the best category can get tricky. (I will be exploring use of symbolic links or shortcuts to add files in multiple categories.)

Nonetheless this effort is still at an early stage

All thoughts are good. Some are better than others. Of course, your current thought is nearly always perfect, but never mind. But is this thought worth keeping? If so, where do you put it? For decades, this has been an issue for me. So much so that good thoughts are needlessly discarded.

Fingers crossed, this system will stop those pesky little flashes of genius from running off into the darkness never to return!
