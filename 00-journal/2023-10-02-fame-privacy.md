# Fame & Privacy

## Privacy

You cannot be famous if you are hidden under a rock

You cannot be private if you want to be famous

You cannot have fame and privacy at the same time

Best of both: micro-fame

people I know espouse privacy and are Telegram users because it is secure, encrypted and "private".

For people who seek privacy and fear surveillance, Telegram is a wonderful tool. It is a great tool for people who want to be private.

But it is not a great tool for people who want to be famous. The reason is simple: Telegram is not a great tool for helping people to be discovered.

Discovery is the key to fame. It is difficult to be discovered if you keep yourself hidden under a rock.

The nature of fame and notability in the sphere of technology seems to be transitioning from the individual to the collective.

In the past, the individual was the focus of fame. These days, the collective is the focus of fame.

Doubleiclicking into the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI)and machine learning, the collective is the focus of fame.

Much of the groundwork was carried out by academics and researchers. The work was done in the open, and the results were published in journals and conferences.

But eeven publishing in journals and conferences was not enough. The work must be discovered by others -  particularly by those who can build on the work and who are not academics and have no free and easy access to such sources.

The result is that much of the research on AI is freely available on the Internet. The work is open and accessible to all. Much of this work is hosted for free on GitHub.

This indicates a huge shift from proprietary, corporate research to open, public research.

It means that researchers are no longer working in isolation. They are able to work in the open with others.

* Technology is becoming a team sport. It is not a solo sport.
* Technology is open and accessible to all. It is not proprietary and closed.
* Technology is becoming more productive, cheaper, faster

Let us encourage artists to imagine the future the arts with similar mission, vision, values - benefits
