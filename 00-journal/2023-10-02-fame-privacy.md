## Preface 2023-10-02

Dear Reader

For years I have avoided publishing my writing in any extensive and organized manner. My concern was that I write on such a wide range of disparate topics that I would lose you as a reader.

But I have come to realize that this was a mistake. I have come to realize that I should not be concerned about losing you as a reader. I should be concerned about losing myself as a writer.

Wow, those last two sentences were generated by GitHub Copilot. I am not sure I would have written them myself. But I like them. I like them a lot. I am going to keep them. Ditto the last four.

OK, Copilot, please shut up and let me talk, OK?

I think I wil first share these words with the collaborators (using Telegram) then publish on SubStack.

Bye for now...

Theo


## Cause for writing

Dear PD, SB and PA

As we begin to explore the possibilities of collaborating of some manner of artistic collective, I thought it would be useful to share my thoughts views on the nature of fame and privacy.

I am using "fame" as a catch-all term for notability, celebrity, popularity, greatness, being discovered etc. I am using "privacy" as a catch-all term for security, surveillance, etc.

I am writing this because for many people today there is a fear of being watched, monitored and surveilled. It is a fear that is shared by many people.

This fear is real and justified for some people. But it is not a fear that I share. I do not fear being watched, monitored and surveilled. In fact, to a limited extent, I welcome it.


## The basic motivation

* You cannot be famous if you are hidden under a rock
* You cannot be private if you want to be famous
* You cannot have fame and privacy at the same time

In all likelihood, most of the great artists that have ever lived are unknown. They were hidden under a rock. They were private. They were not famous. And after their death the great works of these artists just disappeared and we never learned about them

For sure most of the artists we do know about were famous in their time. But they were not famous in their time because they were private. They were famous in their time because they were not private.

For artists that were private such as, Vincent va Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Franz Kafka, and others, it was only because a sibling came to their rescue, prevented their efforts from being lost and that is why we know about them today.

In the world of art, being highly visible matters a lot.

## Privacy

Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is a right that is enshrined in the constitutions of many countries. It is a right that is protected by law. Because privacy is so valued, people take steps to prevent their privacy from being violated.

The backbone of good cooperation is great communication. In this era that means using the Internet. These days the usual starting point is via chat. Popular chat apps include WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc.

People I know who espouse privacy are frequently Telegram users because it is perhaps the most secure, encrypted and "private" chat system.

For people who seek privacy and fear surveillance, Telegram is a wonderful tool. But it is not a great tool for people who seek fame. The reason is simple: Telegram is not a great tool for helping people to be discovered.

And this is where a collaboration of artists can bump into problems.
Discovery is the key to fame. It is difficult to be discovered if you keep yourself private or as I often say "keep yourself hidden under a rock".

### Fame is a team sport

The nature of fame and notability in the sphere of technology seems to be transitioning from the individual to the collective.

In the past, the individual was the focus of fame. These days, the collective is the focus of fame.

Double-clicking into the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the collective is the focus of fame.

Much of the groundwork was carried out by academics and researchers. The work was done in the open, and the results were published in journals and conferences.

But even publishing in journals and conferences was not enough. The work must be discovered by others - particularly by those who can build on the work and who are not academics and have no free and easy access to such sources.

The result is that much of the research on AI is freely available on the Internet. The work is open and accessible to all. Much of this work is hosted for free on GitHub.

This indicates a huge shift from proprietary, corporate research to open, public research.

It means that researchers are no longer working in isolation. They are able to work in the open with others.

* Technology is becoming a team sport. It is not a solo sport.
* Technology is open and accessible to all. It is not proprietary and closed.
* Technology is becoming more productive, cheaper, faster

Let us encourage artists to imagine the future the arts with similar mission, vision, values - benefits


## Fame & Privacy Observations

The key in all this is learning when and where to be discoverable and when to be private.

My feeling

* Use chat for private conversations
* Use social networks for public conversations

If you want to be discoverable, lean hard toward public conversations

* the more complex issues are discussed in public, the more likely they are to be discovered - simply because they are the interesting aspects of the work.

Learn to think in public. Learn to work in public. Learn to share in public.

Follow this fascinating example:

## Topic for Another Time

Best of both: micro-fame

## Closing

I hope this has been useful. I hope that it literally, opens up our discussions.

Bye for now...
