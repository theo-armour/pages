## Regular Activities

### Email & General Writing

I tend to draft any significant email and long form text in Markdown format using VS Code with GitHub Copilot. Copilot's lengthy text suggestions are often surprisingly helpful in rounding out a thought process and in getting a first draft done.

I then copy the text to the email client, invoke Grammarly for a look-see, and send it off.

### Instagram

Create images in Midjourney and post them to Instagram.

### Browser Usage

Edge is my current default browser. From timE to time I use the Compose feature in the Bing sidebar to help generate a new  thought or idea.

### General Research

I use ChatGPT 4 several times a week in sessions lasting a good number of minutes with ongoing Q&A dialogs. I use ChatGPT rather than Bard, because ChatGPT saves and displays previous sessions.

### Coding

My coding in the past few weeks has been lighter than usual because of other duties. Nonetheless, I have used GitHub Copilot with VS Code to help with a few coding tasks. I am in awe of the suggestions it makes.

I am in the process of switching from JavaScript over to Python. From 3D in your browser over to AI-generated Python code.

### Thought of the Day

"And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light." ~ Genesis 1:3

God had voice recognition and text-to-3D conversion long before we did.
