# 2025-10-03 Karl has died

## Bullet points of all my thoughts before I forget them

* By the time I got there, Karl was probably already dead, but we talked to him as if he were still alive for half an hour.
* I know this because Larry later told me that Karl had breathed his last while Larry was still in the room, which was before I went into the room.
* But it's perhaps a good beginning. I like talking to people as if they're still alive.
* During that time, there were a lot of conversations about other people's deaths, other people's premonitions of other people's deaths.
* It reminded me of being in France and having people at a meal talking about other meals More than the meal they were currently eating.
Much of the time I was concerned about whether or not I would have my Friday morning favorite: Denver scramble.
* The kitchen closes at 9:30.
* At 9:23, I asked Ingmari to go to the dining room and save me a portion.
* Why do I do this? How did I get involved? How do I get embroiled in in the death of somebody I hardly knew
* Of course I'm already forgetting some of my thoughts.
* During the 20 minutes or so we talked about Sigmund (Sigi) and how Til re-connected with him for the first time since 1993.
* This was because I gestured Siggy to come over to the table as he was walking down the corridor after visiting Karl. And we had a nice chat altogether.
* Karl died remarkably peacefully, it seems to me. Yes, there were coughs and difficult breathing, but it did not seem painful or as if he was writhing or in agony.
* Now I don't know whether there was no real pain or whether it was the morphine, but in any case, it was pretty darn easy.
* Lillemor called me around 8:45, very distraught, saying Karl was having difficulty breathing.
* I said that we'll be down in a few minutes, I got there probably around nine. There was a lot of commotion in Karl's room.
* They were there with different machines and breathing apparatuses, but then Larry came out carrying some of the devices.
* A minute or two later, a little more came up said I could come in.
* And I could see Karl, eyes closed, mouth open, a gaunt, quiet figure.
* Lillemor made a very moving speech about how much she loved him and what their life meant to her and how they were together. She was very composed, very articulate, very touching.
* Sometimes we gave a phone call to Joe, Karl's brother in Mombasa.
Lillemor held the phone up to Karl's ear so Joe could say goodbye.
* I noticed how much trouble Lillemor had trying to find Joe's phone number on her phone.
* This is because she doesn't really have an address book or contact list. She just has the phone numbers of people that called recently.
* The lack of technical competence is always saddening.
* Then again, the phone call was made using WhatsApp. And it worked quickly. So maybe it's not so bad.
* The hospice lady came. Her name is Pam.
* She wanted Lillemor to try and make decisions.
* That is not what hospice should do in my opinion. Hospice should be telling the person what has to be done.
* The hospice lady then told stories about how, when she was giving hospice to young people, they would seem to know the day that they would die.
* On Thursday, a young child would say, "I'm going to die on Tuesday and I'm going to go to a happy place."
* Yet another instance of somebody talking about another death. Not one * currently that has happened.
* While I was waiting To see what was happening when I first came down, I asked Theo to get me a cup of coffee, which he did.
* Of course, since he only has one hand, So I didn't know how he could steer his truck and carry the coffee at the same time. But he managed to do so, and I complimented him for doing so.
* I sat in a chair next to Karl's room. After a while, Lillemor came out and said I should come in to the room. And that's when we started the 20-minute or so chat.
* After we'd been talking in the room for a while, It was time to just see if Karl was dead or alive. Ingmari tried to take Karl's pulse but kind of gave up and said she would go and find somebody.
* She went out, and a while later, Martha came in with a stethoscope.
Martha listened for vitals and said she couldn't hear anything.
* Oh, here's something I just remembered. After Larry came out, Lillemor came out. I said, "Good morning." I said, "Do you want to take a walk?" We took a long walk down to the Cedar Room and back.
* Actually, I don't really remember where in that timeline that event occurred.
* Anyway, that's when I started saying that talking to people is good. Even if they are dead.
* Because, of course, in my brain they're still alive. And I can talk to them.
* Some of my thoughts include: "I want my Denver Scramble.",How did I ever get involved with something like this? What is the meaning of all of this, and how can I write it down?
* On the other hand, I must not use any device when all this is happening.
And I am learning a little bit how to hug people and touch people.
* On the whole, Lillemor was fairly composed.
* She cried and sobbed, but without being beside herself.
* Anne-Marie was mostly quiet. She did have a little dialogue about the premonition of their grandmother's death.
* Lillemor during the talks had one revelation about being a little girl and having a premonition of being dressed as if 100 years before and being very scared about it and not wanting to tell anybody else about this event.
* She was in a park, Park Moritz?, walking towards the sandbox where they would be playing.
* For years she never went back to the park, afraid of having a repetition of this event.
Eventually, she went back to Park Moritz, and the premonition did not occur. So she had confronted her own bugaboo.
* To me, it sounded as if she thought she could become schizophrenic, Or some kind of dual personality thing, but then chose not to.
* As usual, I remember what things looked like and, to a certain extent, the timeline and the events that happened. But almost no recollection of the dialogue or what people actually said. In other words, I can't quote anybody easily Or with any accuracy.
* Different people have different kinds of memory.
* Seeing Karl reminded me of seeing my mother on her gurney in 1993.
It also reminded me of the death of Floris.
* I don't think any other deaths really came to mind. Karl's face was pale and gaunt, eyes closed, mouth gaping open.
When Martha came in, she tried to close his mouth. But she was only able to close it a little bit, so it was still open.
* In any case, he certainly looked peaceful, calm, and accepting of what was happening.
Lillemor held his hand and his head as she talked to him.
* Lillemor said that Karl's brother Joe was crying when he was talking to Karl.
* Somewhere around 9:45 or so, I left Kar''s room So the hospice worker could take over.
* I went to the dining room and had my dinner, Scrabble, and a cup of coffee at a table by myself.
* One thing in particular: Throughout all of this, I knew this was not a time for devices.
* And even this, I'm not using the computer's sentence completion. I'm just trying to type it with my own words.


## Why do we write bullet points?

* Markdown is closely related to HTML.
* If you just type the way we see words on a sheet of paper, HTML ignores all the line breaks and jams all the lines together. Intuitive Symbol Paragraph. HTML thinks in paragraphs, not lines, so that text can be reformatted independently of screen size.
* One way to get around that is to put text into bullet points. Each bullet point is a separate paragraph, so HTML will preserve the line breaks.
* Another way is to put two spaces at the end of each line. This tells HTML to preserve the line break. But it's almost impossible to tell if there are two spaces at the end of the line or not.
* Whereas the bullet point plus space is very visible.
