## "Where do I begin? I have no idea about any of this stuff! I don't even know where to start!"

Having a mission and vision is really nice, but it's not enough. You need to have a plan to achieve your goals. Here are some examples of how I can help you do that:

ESG and SDGs have been developed by experts over a number of decades. 192 countries are participating at all levels of place, industry, and profession. There are thousands of organizations that are already working on ESG and SDG practices. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are experts in this field. You don't have to do it alone. You can start by reaching out to these people and organizations, and asking for help.

On your behalf, I will contact up to twenty organizations and experts, and ask them to provide you with a consultation. I will also provide you with a list of resources that you can use to learn more about ESG and SDG practices. For example:

There will be people in local, regional, and national organizations that are already working on ESG and SDG practices. I will reach out to these people and organizations, and identify parameters of mutual interest. I will then help you to establish a relationship with these people and organizations, and help you to identify opportunities for collaboration.

There will be trade associations, professional organizations, engineering societies and industry groups that are already working on ESG and SDG practices. I will reach out to these people and organizations, and identify parameters of mutual interest.

Where relevant, I will help you to identify opportunities for collaboration with suppliers, customers and even competitors companies that are already working on ESG and SDG practices.
