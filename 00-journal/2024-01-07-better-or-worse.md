# 2024-01-07 Better or Worse

The other day I was chatting with Eloise and David about life, the future, the world situation, having children and things like that. I can readily understand why it is not easy to feel optimistic about the future and it and quite easy to feel pessimistic. I can also understand that it can feel that having children in this era may not be a not a good idea.

I tried to point out the good things that are happening in the world. That the lives of people all over the world is better than what irt was when I was young. I talked about housing, food, healthcare. None of this countered that fact that there still is a lot of suffering in the world. And that the future may be worse than the present.

Having children is what the devout, the non-cautious, the naive, the uneducated do. How do you describe these people in a polite manner? Having children is what the very rich do. Not having children is what educated, selfless middle class people do.
