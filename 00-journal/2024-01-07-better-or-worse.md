## Finding happiness in a world of suffering


## Preface

The other day I was chatting with Eloise and David about life, the future, the world situation, having children and things like that. I can readily understand why it is not easy to feel optimistic about the future and quite easy to feel pessimistic. I can also understand that it can feel that having children in this era may not be a not a good idea.

At my end, my choice is to be happy. As I like to say: "My ship came in on the sunny side of Easy Street." In talking to Eloise and David, I tried to point out all the good things that are happening in the world despite all the suffering. They were not convinced. I can understand why. And this made me think about ways of responding to the pessimism that many people feel. I am not sure that I will have a good response. But I do have some thoughts.


## Introduction: The problem of suffering

How do you find happiness in a world full of suffering?

In a world devoid of actual meaning, finding happiness in the midst of suffering can be tricky.

Despite many nice things happening, many people are pessimistic.

The pessimism of many people is understandable, and it is preventer or disruptor of happiness.

Nonetheless, for most people, but not all people, happiness is a choice.

This paper proposes some actions that can be taken that may help steer you away from pessimism and towards happiness.


## Premise: Happiness is a choice

* Seeking happiness is a worthy human endeavor
* The endeavor toward happiness is a combination of state of mind, knowledge, and action
* Acting upon the knowledge that you have is a choice can update your state of mind

This paper proposes some actions that can be taken to adjust your perception.

This paper explores the paradox of seeking happiness in a world rife with suffering, proposing actionable strategies to balance realism with optimism.

## There is plenty of Good News

To Eloise and David, I tried to point out the good things that are happening in the world. The lives of people all over the world is better than what they when I was young. I talked about housing, food, healthcare. [Of course, none of this countered that fact that there still is a lot of suffering in the world. And that the future may be worse than the present.]

I am not the only one to feel some optimism about the the current situation. For example, here is NY Times columnist Paul Krugman's take on the current US economic situation.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/opinion/economy-crime-presidential-election.html

>You may have heard about the good economic news. Labor force participation — the share of adults in today’s work force — is actually slightly higher than the Congressional Budget Office predicted before the pandemic. Measures of underlying inflation have fallen more or less back to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target even though unemployment is near a 50-year low. Adjusted for inflation, most workers’ wages have gone up.
>
>For some reason I’ve heard less about the crime news, but it’s also remarkably good. F.B.I. data shows that violent crime has subsided: It’s already back to 2019 levels and appears to be falling further. Homicides probably aren’t quite back to 2019 levels, but they’re plummeting.

As we shall see, my efforts to list all manner of happy things were doomed to failure. But I have learned a lot in the process - as you shall see.


## All it takes is: One Bad Apple

The problem with the listing all good news items is that it only takes a single counter example to mess things up. For example:

* Is it OK if in a group of people that only one person is a murderer?
* Would you like to fly in an airplane with a hundred windows with only a single window that could pop out?
* Is it OK to have a world where most people are OK, but there's always some who have to suffer?

>The bad apples metaphor originated as a warning of the corrupting influence of one corrupt or sinful person on a group: that "one bad apple can spoil the barrel".

## How many good experiences finally outweigh a bad one?

The idea that a number of good experiences cannot outweigh a bad one does not work in this case because we are discussing deep human suffering. A million nice experiences cannot compensate for the wrongful death a single human.

## The Bad News

In the Krugman article mentioned above, he also understands the pessimism. He points to the negative economic sentiment index: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT

Here is another take on negative sentiment:

* https://stevestewartwilliams.substack.com/p/graph-of-the-day-politics-and-teen

> Rates of mental illness among teenagers have increased dramatically over the last decade, with a particularly steep increase among teenage girls.

Pessimism is everywhere! Why?


## Negativity Bias

Here's why!

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias

>The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, is a cognitive bias that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things. In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative. The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations.

### "If it bleeds, it leads"

* https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads

>A basic fact in the news media is that, if a story involves a brutal death or injury of some kind (or the likelihood of it), it is likely to get higher ratings. The more lurid the story, the better its chances of being the ratings leader.

* https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/two-takes-depression/201106/if-it-bleeds-it-leads-understanding-fear-based-media

>_Managing depression requires you to mind your media intake_
>
>Fear-based news stories prey on the anxieties we all have and then hold us hostage. Being glued to the television, reading the paper, or surfing the Internet increases ratings and market shares — but it also raises the probability of depression relapse.


* https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/506947-news-industrys-bleeding-leads-good-for-business-bad-for-the-country/

>Crime stories ask nothing of us. They are emotion-based only. Like a good horror movie, they play with your sense of fear and keep you engaged until the monster is trapped and the end-credits roll. Too many newsrooms are just like movie studios, serving up new monsters, fresh sequels, to make sure you don’t change the channel or cancel your subscription.


## Negative Visualization

Even while talking to Eloise and David, I was aware that I was not offering a good response to their pessimism. They know about al the good things as much as I do. Where we differ is where and how we give weight or emphasis to all good things and bad things that are happening.

A few days later I came across the article below. It offers an alternative way of thinking about the world called negative visualization. It is a technique that the Stoics used to help them appreciate the good things in their lives. It is a technique that I have used for many years. I did not know that it had a name.

>For a few seconds, allow yourself to contemplate how, at this very moment, things could be worse. You could be suffering from a toothache. Your friends could abandon you. Your computer could break, erasing your work. In an instant, the cornerstones for joy and meaning in your life (your health, your relationships, your accomplishments) could go awry in an infinite number of ways. Dismal as it may sound, the Stoics used negative visualization to kindle profound appreciation for the life that they did have. According to Irvine, this practice has the potential to “transform us into individuals who are delighted to be alive.” After all, “the fact that there are so many bad things that aren’t happening is a cause for celebration in itself.”

* https://mindfulnessbox.com/negative-visualization-benefits/

>Negative visualization is the practice of imagining worst-case scenarios, popularized by the Stoics of ancient Rome. Negative visualization exercises can help you be grateful for what you have and appreciate the shortness of life.


### My take on negative visualization

I feel that I am a "frequent flyer" with negative visualization. Som examples:

I am disabled. I am partially paralyzed, and my left hand was amputated. I could not dream of running a mile or playing in a tennis match or of the innumerable things people do to find happiness.

Nonetheless I am really glad that I still have my right hand. I find that it was really lucky that the only muscle on my left foot is the one that prevents "drop-foot" which means that you have to have special shoes to prevent you from tripping.

I spent over ten years learning to be not a terribly good architect but the architectural skills I acquired became useful when I started to write software for the construction industry.

Unlike my parents' acrimonious divorce, my separation from my wife has been amicable and respectful. I am very grateful for that.

I establish my personal gratitude and happiness out of all the bad things that have happened to me. This has allowed me to disengage my own personal suffering from the suffering of others. I can feel compassion for others without feeling that I am suffering myself.


## Where to draw the line?

Suffering is everywhere. How many bugs have I killed each time I crossed a lawn. How many lives could I save if I donated all my money to causes that treat malaria?

Where does self-interest end and altruism begin?

### Link of interest

* Serenity prayer ~  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer

>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.


### My take on where to draw the line

The number of things I can do to alleviate the suffering of others is limited. \<ai>I can donate money to charities. I can volunteer. I can vote for politicians who will help the poor. I can write letters to politicians. I can write articles like this one. I can talk to people. I can be kind to people. I can be kind to myself. I can be kind to Eloise and David. I can be kind to my family. I can be kind to my friends. I can be kind to strangers. I can be kind to myself.\</ai>

I keep my boundaries as close as possible to myself. I cannot save the world.


## I care therefor I am

Just because I cannot save the world does not mean that I do not care.

I heard the following prayer so often in six years at SPS that begin to that I begin to believe it. ;-)

* Saint Paul’s School ~ The School Prayer ~ https://www.sps.edu/living/chapel-program

>"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.


## Attention


I can be thinking of all the suffering in South Sudan, for example, and the next second be thinking about what I am going to be having for dinner then thinking about whether the any crawling on the windowsill will ever find its way home.

Concentrating on a topic implies caring about it. But my mind wanders. I simply cannot care about the Rohingya people in Burma - and many others - 24/7. So it goes. It's OK.

## But

* **Hope for the best, prepare for the worst** Anticipating future negative events can lessen the blow if and when they happen
* **Understand risks so you’re not blindsided by reality** Much of our hardships come from adapting to the new reality of a negative event


## Children

In many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries, there is a trend where lower socio-economic groups tend to have higher fertility rates compared to those in higher socio-economic groups. On the other hand, individuals with substantial wealth may find it more feasible to have children, given their ability to manage the associated financial responsibilities more comfortably. Not having children is what educated, selfless middle-class people do.

## Conclusion

Finding happiness and joy, expressing gratitude, creating beauty, seeking security and safety, and being kind to others are all worthy human endeavors. They are all choices that we can make.

Achievement of these is helped immensely by assiduously avoiding pessimism and negativity while at the same time being aware of the suffering of others and accepting who we are and what we can do.
