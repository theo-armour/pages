# Are you correctly doing the right thing?

"Are you correctly doing the right thing?" is a good question to ask yourself. But what is this question actually saying? This paper is an attempt to answer this latter question o as to enable you to have a better understanding of the former question.

I have been thinking around this question for perhaps ten years or more, But the triad I came up with last night, 2025-12-19, It's the first time I put the whole picture together in my mind, in one thought.

The length of time it takes to come up with a good idea is perhaps a subcategory of the primary premise and could be the topic of further discussions elsewhere.

The idea of putting all of this into a triad is yet another subcategory of thinking related to this thought.That could and should be considered elsewhere.

And there are perhaps other related aspects. Beauty, psychological richness come to mind.

Let us begin to jump into the questions at hand.

The goal of this paper is to provide you with thoughts, tools and questions to help you ask this question about whatever you are doing, thinking, or playing with by supplying you with available tools that will stimulate your answers this question in relevant, meaningful and provocative ways.

* It's the journey, not the destination.
* It's the map, not the territory.
* It's the to-do list, not the just-done list. (maybe!?!)

Why provocative? Well, if nothing else, anything I do I want to be fun and stimulating to do!

I will first parse the original question into three smaller questions.

A triad of questions comes to mind:

1. Am I doing the right thing?
2. Am I doing the thing right?
3. Do I know that I am doing the right thing?

In turn, these three little questions spawn even more!

The next section will be our first introduction into each of the three questions, followed by three chapter with moderately deep dig into each of the three.

## 1. Am I doing the right thing?

Peter Drucker was a mid-20th century business analyst. I have never read any of his books, but I treasure some of his aphorisms! My favorite goes something like this: "Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right." In other words, following procedures correctly makes no difference if the project you are tackling is not worth doing.

Doing the right thing means I must compare what I am doing or plan to do with doing other similar things.

If I'm writing a paper about the financial analysis of a particular stock, Might there not be better stocks to write about? If I am planning to go to the market to buy chicken, might there not be better alternatives such as filet-of-sole? If I have the skills to become an astrophysicist, might there not be better opportunities being a nuclear physicist?

Peter Drucker was not the first to come up with this thought. The concept is millennia old, and there are many established tools and proposals for responding to this question.

Which of these tools is right for your current project? Well, haha!, that is up to you to determine!

* Edward De Bono
* Memory man?

## 2. Am I doing the thing right?

This little question might bring up a myriad of even smaller questions, including:

* Am I following the right rules and procedures?
* Am I helping or hurting the environment?
* Are there other ways of doing it?
* What am I not seeing?
* Can I do it in a better way, or get people to help me?

Again, you are not alone. There are zillion tools out there to help you! And there are people, references and AI to help you find them and build up your own personal checklist on your project.

This section can be quite tricky. For example, here in America, it would be a way that is correct for Republicans to do things, but it would be very incorrect for Democrats. There are things one can say to elderly people that might not be what could be said to very young people.

Nonetheless, there's a myriad of tools and guidelines out there to help you frame your question correctly.


## 3. Do I know that I am doing the right thing?

Yes, we are talking about you, the person performing the act of reading this document.

Perhaps you really are a genius!
Or maybe you're just a know-it-all, anyway. Or you could even be like me: vaguely clueless but curious.

The interesting thing here is that, whoever you are, you are not alone.

I bring up one of my favorite quotes: "I can see further because I stand on the shoulders of giants." - Sir Isaac Newton

All of this is a bit tricky to explain, so I will have to start with sort of a story.

I read a lot of blog posts.This is good stuff because there's so much excellent writing on the internet these days. If you want to look for it. And well, it's been a ton of good writing for thousands of years.

If there is a problem, it's sorting through all the writing and deciding which one is good and which advice should be followed, who is making things up and who are the real heroes?

And so I will share one of my favorite personal aphorisms: "A webpage without a link is like a room without a window."

The concept of a hyperlink was developed by Ted Nelson back in the 1960s. The idea is really simple: a link connects two web pages. From one one page, you can go to another web page Just by clicking. Instantly

* You can see where the thought came from.
* Find even more similar thoughts.
* Identify the giant with loose shoulders.

Aside: Ted's concept of a hyperlink is more powerful. It includes backlinks. A backlink is a link that points back to the original page. This is important because it allows you to see who else is talking about the same topic.

I think links are marvelous!

I don't have to explain everything in detail. I just link to other people's explanations.
I don't have you guessing as to whether my thought is important or not.
I can share things where thousands of people have thought it important.
Hi, I'm letting you see whose shoulders I am standing on.
I'm differentiating between my own thoughts and other people's thoughts And helping you see and know the difference. .

As with the previous two points, there is a ton of classical information and thought on this process.


## All together now

When I start some significant work, I like thinking about a popular thing called:

Mission, Vision, Values

Can I apply my three questions to this thought? I think I can.

* Doing the right thing is establishing the right vision.
* Doing the thing correctly is the mission!
* Following my established value is about observing, developing, and knowing who I am.

Aside
* Hermaneutics
* Epistemology
* Axiology
* Lens of the self

# Conclusion

All of this is the tip of an iceberg!
All I'm doing is trying to connect different frameworks that you already know about and have used in the past.
A bunch of different black boxes.
I am providing a framework for when and how to link them together and turn your good Conjecture or premise into something that is new and unique and helps the world.

Have fun!
