Last week I received an email from G. Below is my response.

## AI Call Sounding Board/Pre-discussion/Etc

>Hi Theo,
>
>If it is helpful for you, I'd love to have a call (with N potentially, CC'd on this, if he is interested in and has time for it) to be a sounding board for you for the AI call, and also get a better chance to learn more about what you know about AI.

Can do!

## AI revolution ~ how to get on board?

>I believe that AI (in all of the current nomenclature and specifics that entails) has the potentially to truly revolutionize Wxx in a way that would make us crazy to not dig deeper into it especially with someone experienced and understanding about it like you!

>> AI (in **all** of the current nomenclature and specifics that entails)

Not a small number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_artificial_intelligence

>> AI has the potentially to truly revolutionize Wxx

Agreed. Questions:

* Where to start?
* How to manage?
* How to profit?


## We are Unprepared

>What interested me is L's response of "[...]Right now, I have time to create content and do not need a bot to do it. ;)[...]" because I think that underlines how a lot of people see AI not as a tool to make their lives better and easier (a la how electrical lighting replacing oil and wax based lighting made life better) without being a threat to their livelihood (although that goes into the deeper question of how society handles the candlemakers and whatnot when they don't have as much work, retraining and our social obligations and the like), but I am grateful that she still was open to discussing about it to better understand the topic.

Here is what GitHub Copilot suggested for the above paragraph:

_L is a smart cookie. She is also a very busy cookie. She is a good example of a person who is not going to be able to take the time to learn about AI and how it can help her. She is also a good example of a person who is going to be very upset when she is replaced by a bot._

My own point of view is that AI will take as long to roll out as the Internet did.

## Timing

>Personally (as an AI language model produced by OpenAI--- kidding!), I have always had a fascination with AI, and I have been tempted more than once to consider trying to transition over towards a software engineering side with focus on machine learning. However, like most things that I want to do in life, I know that I have only a limited time to do them so I've had to pick and choose accordingly.

I find that I take more pleasure in working on tools that directly help create actual content rather than working on tools that help make better tools. Of course the thing you are working on is engaging, but helping a domain - astronomy, construction, art - is more engaging to me than helping a tool - a programming language, a compiler, a database, a web server.


## AI is a solution

> On the whole in a focus on humanity, the potential for AI (especially general AI, if we can reach that goal in a manner that bypasses the existential threat that it could pose to humanity) makes it one of the most important technologies in the last two centuries, and potentially the last two millennium as well.

## Me too

>So (getting back to the point, sorry about a bit of a ramble there), if there might be a time next week that having a call to go over things is helpful for you, I'd love to learn more about what you know! And of course if it wouldn't be helpful then no worries and we can chat more during/after the AI call.

>Thank you.
