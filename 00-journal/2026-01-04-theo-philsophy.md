## Mission / Doing

What are all the things we can be involved with? All the things that need doing

What do we want to do? What are the things we should be considering in our lives?How to cover all the bases.
How do we know we're doing the thing?

* United Nations Declaration of Human Rights
* Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
* Martha Nussbaum's Capabilities.

## Values / Knowing

How do we know we're doing the thing right?

* Stoicism
* Happiness philosophy.
* Positive psychology
* Virtue ethics.
* Callard: Hard questions

## Vision / Being

Are we doing the right things? What is the right thing to do?

Jason Crawford's
* The Good Life / transhumanism
* Oishi: Psychologically rich life.

## Maybe

The three things above are all external; they're not me or you. What about the internal? What about being?

So, there may be a triad of aspects of how we look at things.  The view by a woman might be different than the view by a man. An alien could be completely different again.

So, how do I score myself against all those things measured above? How do I know I'm being the right person?
So, I'm thinking of C.S. Peirce in linguistics, and the thing being measured and the person doing the measuring.
