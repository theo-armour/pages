# SubStack Dear a

This is the beiginning of an explanation, that takes a lot time

* After my accident grandma sends me a postcard every day
* Went on for months
* Random postcards from all over the place.
* The message was always a light-hearted reference to where the "magic-carpet" had taken Grandma that day.
* Made me smile
* Somebody was thinking of me
* Of course, people were feeding me, tending my wounds for me and caring deeply
* But this was something else
* Something that made me feel special
* Something that made me feel like I was not alone
* I never forget this; I have deep and fond memories of this
* Much more than the pain and suffering I frequently felt
* That experience can never be duplicated, but what can be learned from it?
* What can I do to make another person feel something


## Time motion

* What I do is I take a task and I break it down into its smallest parts
* And then I try to add an extra twist to it
* I try to make it more interesting
* I try to make it more fun
* I try to make it more engaging
* I try to make it more useful and valuable
* Example: One of my morning exercises is to gro from sitting to standing a number of times
* After a while I added my arms up over my head and then down to my sides
* Then I added doing a Kegel exercise
* Turning a mindless exercise into something that that requires more mindfulness


## Substack articles

* I want to share my efforts - words, images and software - with the world
* But that has issues being so ephemeral
* I had been thinking about Substack for a while
* In terms of multiple publications - 3D, aging, ontology, people, JavaScript, beauty, security, observations, etc.
* but that gets complicated
* so I have decided to start with a single publication - where I am who I am at the time the article is written
* I am not going to be able to write every day


## Midjourney efforts

* When I was under 12, I was devoted to drawing. Did I produce a drawing a day? But, IIRC, no more than once a day. In my memory, iI took and endless amount of time on each drawing. Looking back, I think in actuality it might have bee ten to fifteen minutes. But it felt like an eternity. I was so focused on the drawing that I was not aware of the time passing. I was in the zone. I was in the flow. I was in the moment. I was in the present. I was in the now. I was in the here and there.

When I went to SPS, the drawing motivation stopped - almost never to return. Reasons: drawing takes time. Hours and hours. Not having had guidance or mentoring the resukts were so often disappointing.
