Hi Jon

Many people in San Francisco believe that that their city is much like other cities in America—the issues of government, prosperity, life style are shared with many similar cities across the land. Let us call these people the San Francisco Village people.

There are other people that might compare San Francisco to ancient Athens or Rome—cities that were the center of the world and changed the world forever. Let us call these people the San Francisco World people.

My observation here is that these the Village and World people have as much connection with each other as left and right side of the brain - in other words, they are hardly connected at all. The they observe the same city through two different lenses

I will try to explode the view of the Village people with a single one line quote.

A document titled "Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead" by Leopold Aschenbrenner, published in June 2024 discusses the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2027. The author recently resigned from the Superalignment team at OpenAI. It is perhaps the latest, most detailed and most highly cited document on the future of AI published in recent months.

The first line of "Situational Awareness" is this:

"You can see the future first in San Francisco."

This is not talking about bike lanes, gay marriage, or the latest in food trends. It is talking about the future of AI and the future of the world. The future of AI is being created in San Francisco and therefore the future of the world is being created in San Francisco.

The document titled "Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead" by Leopold Aschenbrenner discusses the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2027. Here are the key points:

1. **Rapid AI Progress**: The document outlines the significant progress in AI from GPT-2 to GPT-4, which has seen models evolve from generating semi-coherent sentences to solving complex problems and outperforming high school students on standardized tests. This progress is attributed to consistent improvements in compute power, algorithmic efficiencies, and "unhobbling" gains (enhancements that unlock latent capabilities in AI models).

2. **AGI by 2027**: The author argues that AGI, which refers to AI systems capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can, is plausible by 2027. This prediction is based on the trendlines in compute and algorithmic advancements, suggesting another significant leap in AI capabilities similar to the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-4.

3. **Superintelligence**: The document discusses the potential for AI to surpass human intelligence shortly after achieving AGI. This "intelligence explosion" could result in AI systems that are vastly more capable than humans, leading to dramatic economic and military advantages.

4. **Challenges and Security**: The author highlights several challenges, including the need for massive industrial mobilization to support the growth in compute power and the importance of securing AI research from espionage, particularly from state actors like China. The document emphasizes the need for robust security measures to protect AI models and algorithmic secrets.

5. **The Project**: As the race to AGI intensifies, the document predicts that national security forces will become heavily involved, leading to government-led AGI projects by 2027/28. This involvement is seen as necessary to manage the risks and ensure the safe development of superintelligent AI.

6. **Parting Thoughts**: The author concludes by stressing the importance of situational awareness in AI development. He argues that understanding and preparing for the rapid advancements in AI is crucial to navigating the potential risks and benefits.

Overall, the document provides a detailed analysis of the current state of AI, the trajectory towards AGI, and the implications of achieving superintelligence within the next decade.
