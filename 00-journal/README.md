# Journal Read Me

Drafts of files that I might like one day to publish. In other words documents ith thoughts I feel might be shareable.

## Guidelines

* Articles may be presented as APL problems that may have patterns
* Articles may state the intention of what is trying to be helped
* Articles are shared from the get-go
* Articles provide connections to other articles, sources and inspirations
* Articles are an inspiration for writing good articles
