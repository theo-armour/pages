## Concept

Drafts of files that I might like one day to publish. In other words documents with thoughts I feel might be shareable.

This is my "original research" folder. The other folders tend to follow the Wikipedia of "no original research".


## Guidelines

* Articles may be presented as A Pattern Language (APL) problems that may have patterns
* Articles may state the intention of what is trying to be helped
* Articles are shared from the get-go
* Articles provide connections to other articles, sources and inspirations
* Articles are an inspiration for writing good articles
