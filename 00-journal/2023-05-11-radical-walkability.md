# 2023-05-11 Radical Walkability

A natural idea is to live in a place where you can walk to everything you need. This helps your life to be fast easy and cheap - and it's good for the environment.

The things we want with an easy walk may include a supermarket, hardware store, library, park, and a few restaurants.

My address gets a walks score of 97 https://www.walkscore.com/score/3400-laguna-st-san-francisco-ca-94123. About as good as it gets.

The issue with these walk scores is that they look at the basic necessities of life. They don't look at the things that make life fun and interesting. They don't look at the things that make life truly worth living.

For example for many folks life is no fun without a nearby Apple store. For others it might be a yacht club, a commercial numismatist or even a spectacular bridge to look at. Well, of course, I have all these in my 'hood otherwise I wouldn't be writing this. Prisons within swimming distance don't count either.

But what is the true measure of extreme or radical walkability? It must be something very rare, offers something especially special, and is nonetheless within walking distance.

So, guess where I am walking to in a couple hours? A real Michelin three star restaurant. One of just 137 in the whole, entire world.

In a world seeking radical walkability, I'm making strides, one Michelin-starred step at a time.

I have a reservation for the entry-level five course snack menu. I will relate details of the experience in a future post.
