# AI

AI seems to be managed by people that are a lot older.Then the people that manage the.com era.Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, were in their 20s. Sam Altman, Brockman and the others are in it, well into their 30s.The new generation seems to be more completely educated and have social and ethical parameters or consciousness then some of their Predecessors.


I believe that the ethics and morality of the current generation of AI developers is also more developed than the.The predecessors.Was very much about gaining power and acquiring money.The newer generation is much more the spirit of doing something good and helping the world. And improving the lives and conditions of many people.


I find the new technology surprisingly fun.It's allowing me to visualize my thoughts.And to expand my thinking. Am I able to see what I couldn't see?

At a recent webGL meet up, at the end of the session, there was a Q&A with about a dozen panelists standing on stage. I asked them a question: are you using AI or GitHub CoPilot in any of your efforts? There was not a single yes. One of the participants, a PhD from China, did call up an assistant who said he had used GitHub CoPilot.


It is worth pointing out that.Most of the AI models use historic data. for example, combat chat. Chip BTstopped gathering data in 2021. On the other hand, today's computer programmers are running brand new code.That relies on algorithms that were not in existence.Before 2021. And the new algorithms are not based on historic data. They are based on the current data. Therefore, the current ChatGBT and AI and Large language model tools may not be useful in writing brand new software.

Where AI may be useful might be in helping C level students become B level students. [It reminds me of IBM in the 50s and 60s. For their sales force, IBM more frequently selected average students over the better students and finding easier to improve the average and to control the smartest.] AI will help the person wants to do less work mor than thr person who is already working hard.

AI will help the person want to do shortcuts. In other words, it may be an asset for people who are wanting to do naughty things, but it will not be an asset for people who are already doing good things. AI may be a tool for finding shortcuts to circumvent rules and regulations.

On other hand, AI may be hugely helpful to people for whom English is a second language. Or for people with limited vocabularies. In doing so, AI may become a good teacher.Or mentor.

If, ultimately, the gods of AI decide to wipe out the human race.Then probably the issue way of doing that would be to entertain us and pressure us to death.Which might not be a bad way to go? If we are going to die, we might as well have fun doing it.

Media Hype: Here is what CoPilot says about AI: "AI is the next big thing. AI is going to take over the world. AI is going to kill us all. AI is going to make us all rich. AI is going to make us all poor. AI is going to make us all slaves. AI is going to make us all free. AI is going to make us all happy. AI is going to make us all sad. AI is going to make us all healthy. AI is going to make us all sick. AI is going to make us all smart. AI is going to make us all stupid. AI is going to make us all creative. AI is going to make us all boring. AI is going to make us all rich. AI is going to make us all poor. AI is going to make us all slaves. AI is going to make us all free. AI is going to make us all happy. AI is going to make us all sad. AI is going to make us all healthy. AI is going to make us all sick. AI is going to make us all smart. AI is going to make us all stupid. AI is going to make us all creative. AI is going to make us all boring. AI is going to make us all rich. AI is going to make us all poor. AI is going to make us all slaves. AI is going to make us all free. AI is going to make us all happy. AI is going to make us all sad. AI is going to make us all healthy. AI is going to make us all sick. AI is going to make us all smart. AI is going to make us all stupid. AI is going to make us all creative. AI is going to make us all boring. AI is going to make us all rich. AI is going to make us all poor. AI is going to make us all slaves. AI is going to make us all free. AI is going to make us all happy. AI is going to make us all sad. AI is going to make us all healthy. AI is going to make us all sick. AI is going to make us all smart. AI is going to make us all stupid. AI is going to make us all creative. AI is going to make us all boring. AI is going to make us all rich. AI is going to make us all poor. AI is going to make us all slaves. AI is going to make us all free. AI is going to make us all happy"

AI is the current media buzzword.Quotes like the above fill the press. It's like AR and AV and BitCoin and whatever. The lesson we learned from all of these is that it will take a lot longer than the media hype suggests. And that the media hype is not a good predictor of the future.

AI Is far more open than previous eras of technology - Which tends to be highly secretive and proprietary. Many papers are openly published and detailed descriptions of operation, if not source code or provided. It's a change from being economic or monetary competitors to being frenemies.
