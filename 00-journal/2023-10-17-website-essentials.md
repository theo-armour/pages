## Links in the content

"A webapage without links is like a room without windows" :- Theo Armour

If a webpage is interesting how do I continue the engagement that I have with the content on tht specific page? Answer: this is not an issue if the page includes links.

Bing:

As an AI, I don't form personal opinions. However, I can share that some people might agree with your statement because hyperlinks in a webpage provide pathways to other related content, much like how windows in a room provide views to the outside world. Without links, a webpage might feel isolated or self-contained, similar to a room without windows. On the other hand, others might argue that a webpage without links can still provide valuable content, just as a room without windows can have its own unique charm and function. It can depend on the specific context and purpose of the webpage or room.

If a page makes strong statements, how can I fact check the page.

Again, is the page includes links I have more ability to gauge the trush of the statements.
