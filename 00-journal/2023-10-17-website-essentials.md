### Articles and stories

### Stories

One of the great things about the internet is that there are a lot of great stories that are published daily. There's a lot of rubbish as well, but that's another story.

For this discussion, "stories" refers to content created by writers whose prime job is writing stories on a regular bases in return of a salary. But it could also be the marketing pages of a web site

### Articles

One of the great things about the internet is that there are a lot of great articles that are published daily. There's a lot of rubbish as well, but that's another story.

For this discussion "articles" refers to content created by professionals in a variety of disciplines. The articles are published in journals and magazines. The articles are peer reviewed and edited by professionals.

### Comparison of Stories and Articles

"Stories" are for the fun of it. Stories are what you read in a magazine or newspaper - digital or online. Articles are, fingers crossed, verifiable, authoritative and trustworthy. Articles are what you read in an academic journal or Wikipedia..


### From Bing Chat

The difference between an article and a story is that an article is a piece of writing that provides information about a particular topic, event, or person. It is usually written in a formal style and follows a specific structure. Articles are often published in newspapers, magazines, and websites. On the other hand, a story is a piece of writing that tells a tale or narrates an event. It can be fictional or non-fictional and is usually written in a narrative style. Stories can be found in books, magazines, and websites.

When you are building a web site, which is it? A story or an article?

If it is a story, then you can write whatever you want. You can make up stuff. You can be funny. You can be serious. You can be whatever you want.

If it is an article, then you need to be careful. You need to be accurate. You need to be authoritative. You need to be trustworthy.

This article is about helping you design websites that are articles.


## Features & Benefits

Here are three links that discuss features and benefits:

### A Simple Trick to Turn Features Into Benefits (and Seduce Readers to Buy)

> Features are facts about products or services
> Benefits give customers a reason to buy because they explain how your product or service improves their lives.


### Features vs. Benefits: What Are the Key Differences

* https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/feature-vs-benefit

>A feature is an attribute or functionality of a product or service. It's what a product does or the use it has. Features add substance to your marketing efforts. It's useful to describe them to people who are looking for a specific product or service.
>
>A benefit is how a product or service can improve or add value to a customer's life. Benefits answer the question, "What can this product or service do for me?" for consumers. In marketing, it's helpful to describe how a product or service can solve an audience's particular problems.

>Let’s cut to the chase. When it comes to peddling your wares, there’s one main thing you need to know: Customers don’t care about what your product can do… they care about what it can do FOR THEM.


### My take

A good website sends out both messages

* Features make engineers happy
* Features are part of the mission statement
* Benefits make managers happy
* Benefits are part of the vision statement


## Links in the Content

"A webpage without links is like a room without windows" :- Theo Armour

If a webpage is interesting how do I continue the engagement that I have with the content on tht specific page? Answer: this is not an issue if the page includes links to other resources.

Bing:

As an AI, I don't form personal opinions. However, I can share that some people might agree with your statement because hyperlinks in a webpage provide pathways to other related content, much like how windows in a room provide views to the outside world. Without links, a webpage might feel isolated or self-contained, similar to a room without windows. On the other hand, others might argue that a webpage without links can still provide valuable content, just as a room without windows can have its own unique charm and function. It can depend on the specific context and purpose of the webpage or room.

If a page makes strong statements, how can I fact check the page?

Answer: this is not an issue if the page includes links.

Again, is the page includes links I have more ability to gauge the truth of the statements.

### GitHub Copilot Response

Me: how important are links in a good webpage?

GitHub Copilot: Links are crucial in a good webpage for several reasons:

1. **Navigation**: Links allow users to navigate between pages on your website, or to other websites, making the web an interconnected network of information.

2. **SEO**: Search engines use links to crawl the web; the links between the individual pages on your website, and the links between entire websites. This helps in improving your website's visibility in search engine results.

3. **User Experience**: Well-placed and descriptive links can guide users to the information they're interested in, improving their overall experience on your site.

4. **Authority and Credibility**: Linking to authoritative sources can lend credibility to your content, showing that your information is backed by reliable sources.

5. **Engagement**: Links can keep users engaged with your content and spend more time on your site by providing them with easy access to related content.

Remember, while links are important, they should be used appropriately. Too many links can distract and frustrate users, and links to irrelevant or low-quality sites can harm your site's SEO.
