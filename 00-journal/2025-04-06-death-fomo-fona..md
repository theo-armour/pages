# Title: Death FOMO and FONO ~ Date: 2025-04-06

## Death FOMO ~ fear of missing out

* If I am as happy as can be, then how could I be missing out on anything?
* How could I possibly be any happier than I am now?
* Yes, I may miss out, but I'm not missing out on anything that's better than what I have now.
* A source for this idea is probably Kurt Vonnegut: "If this isn't happiness, I don't know what is."

## Death FONA ~ Fear of never arriving

* If I have set all my goals and targets as being unachievable and only directions, then how could I fear never arriving?
* If I set my goals and targets to be as virtuous and as good as truthful as possible, then how can I think of something more virtuous?

Why am I alive?

Is that a hypothetical question?

Life is a joke.

You can imagine any purpose, cause, activity, or goal you want.
You can imagine any reason for being alive you want.

If there were an afterlife, it would be an unbelievably cruel thing for them not to let us know that there was something after death.
