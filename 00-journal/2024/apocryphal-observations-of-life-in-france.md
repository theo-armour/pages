# Apocryphal Observations of Life in France


The following texts are snippets I prepared in preparation for the glorious Boxing Day dinner party Cynthia and I hosted at the cottage at Heritage on the Marina on December 26, 2024.

## Wines

The wines I have chosen are typical wines that people drink at certain time periods. And by people, from here on, of course, I mean French people in France.

If you are really on the case, you choose your wines by going down the mainly the wine list. But if you don't have the time or the energy, you just ask for the wine that should be. It's not a plan B. It's not a fallback. It's just that's the way things are.

The wines tonight may or may not be good, but I think each one will be of its of its type. And therefore worth noticing on its own.

### Macon Village

The first one is Macon Village (think Sauvignon Blanc but generally is a Chardonnay grape). This is the one from the Loire Valley in France. This is the sort of wine that a French businessman will have at a typical French lunch, because of course you have to have a glass of wine to drink at lunch. It's the wine we would have at the community table at the Travellers Club on the Champs Elysées

This is a daily lunch wine because if it were a good lunch, you would actually have to decide which one you'd drink. So this is the wine of least decision-making.

### Rosé de Provence

The second wine, a rosé Provence is the wine must drink in August anywhere in France, breakfast, lunch or dinner. All year long you must decide which wine to drink. In August you take a holiday from making choices. You simply say "Waiter, please bring over a pitcher of the house rosé."

### Rhône Wine Region

The third wine is of course, a snooty wine. It's a wine your family has been drinking for decades. It's the wine you serve at parties and receptions to reassure your guests that you are a person. The wine is not too cheap nor too expensive. It's the wine that says "I know what I'm doing."

Tonight we are serving a wine from the Rhône wine region. A bit heavier than a Burdundy (think Pinot Noir) but lighter than a Bordeaux (think Cabernet Sauvignon). I was looking for a Gigondas by from an importer called Guigal, but the Guigal wine I did found was a Saint Joseph from 2019 in the same price range as a Gigondas which tends to be in the 40s to 60s. Fingers crossed: we like it

## Cheeses We Ate

* Brillat Savarin - easy soft cheese crowd pleasers
* Camembert - the character cheese by definition
* Aged Mimolette - Easy crowd pleasing hard cheeses
* Epoisses - crowd pleaser with character. As Yves Nalet pointed out: "Epoisses is proof of the existence of God"
* Tomme de Savoie - both offer different textures and stronger flavors

### Always Remember

* Never cut the nose of these cheeses
* Keep the cheese pretty looking
* Start with the softest cheese and work your way to the hardest
* Start with the mildest cheese and work your way to the smelliest

Obey these rules or anticipate the wrath of the cheese gods.


## What is Remembered Lives

_Cynthia with a box of Rademaker's Hopjes_

_If I had remembered, you would have also heard something like the following_

I'm holding Up a box of candies. It holds a candy you probably never heard of. A Dutch candy called Rademaker's Hopjes. When Alix moved to Amsterdam, I asked her to send me a box. She did And they have been sitting on my shelf waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Why?

Sometime in 1950 or 1951. My grandparents took my sister Tania and I to the seaside on the French coast. It could have been Deauville or Le Touquet. At some tourist shop on the beachside promenade, my Garndma purchased a box of candies and gave my sister and I each one.

In those days it was quite acceptable to give young children caffeinated sugar cubes. Never mind. My sister and I found the candies to be a delight.

Ever since, Rademaker's Hopjes have appeared in my life from time to time. Sometimes at a New York store specializing in imported candies. Sometimes at a Dutch store in Schipol Airport in Amsterdam.

Ever since, every time I taste a Hopjes, I am transported back to that day on the beach. And I remember my grandparents. And I remember my sister. And I remember the shop. And I remember the taste of the candy. I remember the sweet joy of the moment.

My advice is collect and sprinkle things into your life ourself that trigger your memory to of those moments of joy. Save them for a rainy day. And when you need a lift, take them out and remember. And be happy.

The moral of this story is that whatever is remembered lives.
