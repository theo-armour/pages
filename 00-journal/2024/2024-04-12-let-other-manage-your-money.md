## I don't want to be a money manager

If you manage your money carefully and diligently, then you may become a money manager. This is fine. But what if you feel that you may find more satisfaction in other pursuits? Then, let someone else manage your money. This is also fine.

## Real peoplw
My money managers have all been people I know mostly because of family relations. I like the idea that somebody that I know is sweating bricks managing my money I also like knowing that they are infested in the same funds and markets that I'm invested in that their money and my money are playing the same game.

## Let them do their job

As a rule of thumb I've let the money managers manage 90% of my money and not thought that about 10% of my money is my own play money where I can actually guide and direct investments or other adventures. To this extent I was actually quite successful. Because of little things like this that I invested in Apple, Autodesk and especially Microsoft and made a lot of money.

## Succession

As I get older, having a money manager means that I don't have to worry about dying and then having my children to pick up the pieces. It is also meant that he is advising my children on their investments and their futures. He's doing a good job and this is wonderful

## Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda

I probably would be a lot richer except for the following

When I left Autodesk I didn't go back into another salary job but tried to be an agile investor and do startups nnew line throughout my life i've allowed people to take advantage of me and essentially take money from me and not pay it back your line the legal separation and division of funds really made us lose a lot of money. Running to our households is not cheap

## Investing

I always have been an investor not a speculator. I buy something for the long term not because I think it's gonna double money quickly. To in the stocks that I bought such as Apple and Microsoft

## Monitoring
I love looking at how much money I have when the stock market is going up. When the stock market is going down I just don't look. I don't want to know.

## Withdrawals

My general thoughts are like this: the stock market on average close up around 8% per year. This happened more or less for decades. So being 100% invested in the stock market my plan is generally to take out about a third for my own life, put a third for taxes, and then let the rest appreciate. In other words I try and live on 3% of my assets per year.
