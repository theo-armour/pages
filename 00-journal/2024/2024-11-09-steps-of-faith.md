>Steps of Faith Foundation is a non-profit public charity dedicated to providing prosthetic care, hope, and comfort to amputees needing financial support. We help uninsured and underinsured amputees get the prosthetic limbs they need.

AI: SOFF appears to be a well-funded, well-funded charitable organization. They have a strong social media presence and a well-designed website. They have a clear mission and a strong track record of helping amputees in need. They also have a network of partners and supporters who help them raise funds and awareness for their cause. Overall, SOFF seems like a reputable and effective organization that is making a positive impact in the lives of amputees.

## Me + AI:

If a state that does not fully fund prosthetic care is considering doing so, then this type of organization will be the first to lobby against providing coverage. They will argue that they are already providing the service and that the state should not duplicate their efforts. This is a common argument used by non-profits to protect their turf and funding sources. It is important for policymakers to carefully consider the impact of such organizations on public policy and to ensure that all stakeholders are represented in the decision-making process.

Pardon my cynicism, but I have seen this type of behavior before. Non-profits can be just as self-interested and self-serving as for-profit corporations.

The United States is an outlier among developed countries in not providing universal healthcare coverage. This means that many people are left without access to essential medical services, including prosthetic care. While organizations like SOFF are doing important work to fill this gap, they should not be used as an excuse for the government to shirk its responsibility to provide healthcare for all its citizens. Universal healthcare coverage is a human right, and it is the government's duty to ensure that all people have access to the care they need.
