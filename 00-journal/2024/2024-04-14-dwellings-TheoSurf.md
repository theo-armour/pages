# Dwellings

Hi Cynthia

This paper is being written for you. It is written with the idea that it may help inform you with some of the notions of "place" that you may have been considering.

I have no thesis to convey or position that I argue for. But, of course me being me, I am trying to posit a fresh perspective. This time on the notion of "place" and what comes after.

Love,

Daddy

I have lived in a number of dwellings. In every location, once settled in I have tried to transform what was there into something that pleased me - "designs" that I felt would bring future happiness.

I have repeated this process dozens of times. Not just putting up posters, but building, commissioning, and constructing things that were not there before.

In virtually every place I built with a vision of being there with a longer duration than I or we were actually there. Visioning a future that was not to be. Visualizing impermanence is tricky.

I think back on the time, resources and energy that was devoted to each of these dozens of projects. Captivating at the time but now mostly forgotten. More provoking is the realization that the future I was designing and building for was simply not to be.

There are good reasons.

Society is set of for the ordinary. People grow up. Get jobs and marry. Have a family. Buy a house. Grow old and retire. Rinse and repeat.

But not all people do this. Circumstances change. Some people must move.

And, perhaps, some people move by their nature. And, if like me, both circumstance and nature conspire to move you, then you will have lived in many dwellings.

In retrospect, as I sit here with my glass of wine, I can imagine a possible regret. The number of moves is wonderful. The number of dwellings is a testament to a life well lived. But the number of projects that were started and never finished is a bit of a shame.

What if there was a project or projects that I could have carried out in parallel to all the moves?

What if there had been a project that I could always return to? A project that would have been a constant in my life. A project that would have been a touchstone for all the moves.

In all the moves I think I sensed this. Once all the family places had "gone" (they are stil there but "belong" to others), no place in the US ever resonated as a venue of long duration. Ditto Hong Kong. The only place that struck a chord was Ressons-le-long. Not 1 Rue du Cleux. It was too humble and close to the road. The Grange or something in the jardin potagier were possibilities. What really struck a chord was the open air hay barn on th left before you arrive at La Ferme de la Montagne. I imagined transforming it into an "atelier" for the family. On the ground floor the bedrooms, upstairs a huge open space with views to the valley.

Much as I was captivated by this dream - for years, I do not think I would be the happy person that I am today if the dream of a barn had been enacted. It might have resulted in a fruitless fruition ;-)

In the current era there are too many places that are wonderful or interesting or worthy of study.

So what is today's dream?

"Place" is is much of what drives dreams. You see a place you know and you want to make something there. But when I consider all the places belonging my family peeps over three or four generations, I say: "Baloney!" Too many places that evaporated. Perhaps they engendered a good time, but not a good investment. In monetary terms: a speculation but not an investment.

Let us go back to the hunter gatherers: place is immaterial. See "The Dawn of Everything". Let us follow the traditions of a billion Chinese. Family, clans, and tribes are the only places that matter. The rest is just a place to sleep.

## Notes

* Detailed reflections on specific dwellings are missing. Each dwelling could be the topics of many papers.
* You can't take it with you. You can't go home again. The work you put in has mostly already been obliterated by the new owners. The new owners are not interested in your work. They have their own dreams.

## More

* Owning houses reduces flexibility
* Moving sucks but helps with disposing of stuff
* Cheaper to rent?
* The more you own the more you are open to bad things happening to what you own ~ ie theft, fire, flood, etc.
* if buying a house is just about money then it is a bad investment
* if buying a house is about a place to live for decades then it may be a good investment
* Is generational contact useful?
* Is a "clan" useful?
* Is heredity the strongest determinant of too many things?
* House are useful for people having babies or keeping pets
* House without babies may well be seen as demonstrations of wealth, position and power
* You live in the perfect house, so then what?
* House filled with inheritances prevented commissioning new things and set a style that reflects the past

## Alternatives

* Own an RV
* Build a tiny house (on wheels)
* Help restore an old castle
* Live in a commune
* Live in a co-housing community
* Build a "family company"
* Be a life style person

## later

* Each dwelling has its own narrative, its own story. You could say that each helped form the person I am today. Actually, no question, this happened.
* Each project stood on its own, with little regard for the previous projects. It might have been nice to have a long term vision
