## What does getting older mean to you when it comes to how you feel and look?

I grew up in an extremely rich, intensely boring, woefully educated, dysfunctional family. Six years at Saint Paul's School in Concord NH left me as a boring, entitled, introvert. In my early twenties I fell off the roof of my dorm and lost my left hand and remain partially paralyzed from the waist down. None of this was a recipe for a happy life.

Somehow—over the decades—I pulled the rabbit out of the hat, magic happened and connecting, gaining agency, finding joy, and being in the moment became my life. I am now 77 and have never been happier.But maybe it wasn't just magic. Maybe it was the result of a lot of hard work, a lot of luck, and a lot of love. And maybe it was the result of a lot of self-care.

Just to boast a bit, some milestones:

* In the eighties, I helped thousands of people in East Asia learn Computer Aided Design in order to make products and build factories. There were many good students.
* In the nineties I designed the software, AutoCAD, that in essence, transformed the world from drawing on paper to designing on computer
* In the teens, I helped promulgate the the open source JavaScript library, Three.js, that has transformed the world of 3D graphics on the web.
* Coming up next: Creating immortal digital replicas of you and me using AI

BTW, did I mention that I failed in my attempt to swim the English Channel after nine and a half hours, but did "escape" from Alcatraz. And that I have three awesome daughters and former wife. And now I live in a retirement community that is very close to being in heaven. I can do a plank for three minutes and hobble 5,000 steps a day.

So

"Age is merely the number of years the world has been enjoying you." Or in this instance: me.

## Do you have a self-care routine? It can be anything from skin care to meditation.

Yes, I:

* Keep a daily journal
* Have a daily schedule of activities and exercises
* Have weekly schedule of activities
* Maintain things to do list and a list of things done
* Some tasks have been followed for decades

My lists covers a lot of ground. They follow David Allen's GTD idea: get things out of your head and into a system

* Exploring, develop and maintain a self-care routines that work for me and could help others
* Studying, documenting and sharing care mindfulness
* Letting myself be happy, touch and be
