* The pollsters are wrong
* It's a liberal press observes through faulty lenses
* Harris losing the election is not what it's about
* It's about Trump winning the election
* If you include the people who didn't vote such as convicted felons, the homeless, the illiterate, he has four more than half the population as followers who wish for change.
* Harris promised stability / Trump promised disruption
* Politics is not like what it used to be. It is far more interesting

My current life is quite wonderful. My guess is that a year from now my life will still be wonderful.

At the same time the lives of a large portion of my country are not wonderful. Today that large number of people may have a hope that their lives may become wonderful.

Oops I forgot that in America less than half the people eligible to vote actually vote. Probably most of the people whose lives are not wonderful are also not voters

>Democrats walked into the trap of defending the very institutions — the “establishment” — that most Americans distrust.

> Instead of defending a system that has been rejected, we need to articulate an alternative vision for what kind of democracy comes next.

>Once in power with a supine Republican-controlled Congress and judiciary, Trump will govern despotically as a populist based on his uninformed and increasingly delusional understanding of the nation and its challenges, wreaking havoc on the American political economy and the global political order.

>But what we will see on our screens is golf greens, hamburger dinners in the Whitehouse, Melania's fashion, and Ivanka's latest business venture.

>The lesson of 2024 isn’t that this managerial effort failed to protect swing voters from fake news. It’s that it succeeded in a more perverse purpose: It protected liberals from reality, from seeing all the ways that their own choices were leading downward to a predictable defeat.

>The election forecaster Nate Silver’s complex model gives Trump a 60 percent chance of victory — but the forecasting at his former home, FiveThirtyEight, thinks Harris has a 57 percent chance of winning.

>Donald Trump has a very clear story. It’s, make America great again. We’re going to take you both back to some sort of mythic time when America was great, and also something, something Elon Musk rockets.

>politics is about selling some kind of vision or story that taps into what it is that the populace is thinking and feeling at any particular moment

>the stroke of genius of Donald Trump to put his name on the stimulus checks. He knows that branding, that putting himself at the center of this emotional place and responding to the emotions that Americans are having is great marketing. I mean, this is a guy who knows how to connect with people.

>the Democratic Party is always that it tries to lead people by their heads. And the Republicans are much better at leading people by their guts.

> a Trump-Musk administration

>And I think the quality needs to be an electric connection with some deeply felt and aspirational idea that’s oriented to the future that can be kindled within the American people.

Voter turnout 65% ~ https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/06/us-presidential-election-2024-voter-turnout-comparison/

Others at 35% is just as significant as Dems & Reps


Messaging ~ nice summary: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-does-the-word-message-mea-HjfwfjmARg.HiWoMo447gg#0

## Messaging according to Perplexity AI

Dems message: identity politics: gender, race, sexual orientation

Reps message: economy, security

AI: Both parties use messaging to appeal to voters. Messaging is a form of communication that is used to persuade or influence people. It can be used to convey information, promote a product or service, or shape public opinion. Messaging can take many forms, including advertising, public relations, social media, and political campaigns. It is an important tool for politicians, businesses, and organizations to communicate with their target audience and achieve their goals.


## Messaging: Me

### Conjecture: Dems: Exclude ~ Reps: Include ~ Others: ??

Dems message: blacks, women, hispanic, gay, disabled

* Each "identity" one tends to ignore or even exclude or even cast blame on the "other side"
* Thus. he more groupings one belongs to the smaller the number the cohort. Many people may be Black but fewer identify as gay AND black AND a women.

Reps message: NASCAR, local football teams ("Rams"), Denominations ("Southern Baptist"), Individual pod-casters ("Rogan")

* Each grouping is additive. The more groups one belongs to the larger the cohort.
* Thus, the number in the cohort of Southern Baptists is large, but the number of people who are Southern Baptist OR NASCAR or Dodgers supporters is huge


## Media Conjectures

Conjecture: Dems: Textual ~ Reps: Oral ~ Others: ??

Conjecture: Dems: Sell? lecture? ~ Reps entertain ~ Others: ??

Conjecture: Dems: logic, facts, evidence ~ Reps: emotions, feelings ~ Others: ??


## 2024 Voting Demographics Conjectures

Dems:

* Pro-choice females did not turn out in the large numbers anticipated

Reps:

* Males and "stay-at-home" females turned out in greater numbers than anticipated


## Polling

Polls anticipated a 50-50 split. The actual split was often up to 5% different from the polls.

Conjecture: Dems: Poll by email ~ Reps: poll by text??  ~ Others: ??

* Email is becoming less accurate
