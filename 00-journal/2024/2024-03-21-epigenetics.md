# Epigenetics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics

>Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that occur without altering the DNA sequence.[1] The Greek prefix epi- (ἐπι- "over, outside of, around") in epigenetics implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional DNA-sequence-based mechanism of inheritance.[2] Epigenetics usually involves changes that persist through cell division, and affect the regulation of gene expression.[3] Such effects on cellular and physiological traits may result from environmental factors, or be part of normal development.
