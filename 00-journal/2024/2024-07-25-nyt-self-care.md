How Do You View Self-Care as You Age?
We want to hear about what taking care of yourself while getting older means to you.

July 19, 2024

How do you care for your body as you get older? Do you use nutrition, meditation or hobbies like swimming or dancing to help you reset? What we see in the mirror as we get older can bring joy, tumult or simply an opportunity to acknowledge the passing of time. So we want to hear from you about the things you do for health, vanity or fun to help us understand what aging looks and feels like.

We may reach out to hear more about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first and we will never publicly share your personal information.
