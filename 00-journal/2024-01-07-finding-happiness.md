# 2024-01-07 Find happiness in a world of suffering


## Preface 2024-01-09

I start with stating a problem and establish a mission and vision toward finding the solution to the problem.I describe the background to the problem. I then explore the problem and the solution. I end with a conclusion.

See: https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/10-philosophy-and-thinking/patterns/patterns-apl-alexander.md

Paraphrasing Alexander: "A pattern is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within an established context, describing one of the configurations that brings a new life to the discussion. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in society, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

## Asides & jumps or leaps in the text

As I write, I ask myself questions about what I am writing about and because if the Internet I can immediately try to find answers. I have included some of these questions and answers in the text. I have also included some of the links that I found interesting.

These "asides" are more or less relevant to the main topic. But I have included them anyway. I have also included some of the links that I found interesting.

The complex topic and these asides do make for a paper that jumps about. I am trying to add thoughts that show the connections between the various topics. Better connections is a work in progress.

As and when I accept a lengthier suggestion I bracket the text with \<ai> and \</ai> tags.

## Imprecise language

This is a paper about suffering, pessimism and happiness.

This paper tends to assume that a pessimistic person is less likely to be a happy person. My guess is that this is not necessarily true. There are likely to be many pessimistic people who are quite happy. There are many optimistic people who are not happy.


## Contents

## 1.0 Problem Statement

* Setting the initial context of the problem
* Establishing the concept
* Stating the mission and vision


## 1.1 The problem of suffering

The other day I was chatting with Eloise and David about life, the future, the world situation, having children and things like that. I can readily understand why it is not easy to feel optimistic about the future and quite easy to feel pessimistic. I can also understand that it can feel that having children in this era may not be a not a good idea.

At my end, my choice is to be happy. As I like to say: "My ship came in on the sunny side of Easy Street." In talking to Eloise and David, I tried to point out all the good things that are happening in the world despite all the suffering. They were not convinced. I can understand why. And this made me think about ways of responding to the pessimism that many people feel. I am not sure that I will have a good response. But I do have some thoughts.


## 1.1 Mission: Finding happiness in a world of suffering

How do you find happiness in a world full of suffering?

In a world devoid of actual meaning, finding happiness in the midst of suffering can be tricky.

Despite many nice things happening, many people are pessimistic.

The pessimism of many people is understandable, and it is preventer or disruptor of happiness.

Nonetheless, for most people, but not all people, happiness is a choice.

This paper proposes some actions that can be taken that may help steer you away from pessimism and towards happiness.


## 1.2 Premise or vision: Happiness is a choice you can make

* Seeking happiness is a worthy human endeavor
* The endeavor toward happiness is a combination of state of mind, knowledge, and action
* Acting upon the knowledge that you have is a choice can update your state of mind

This paper proposes some actions that can be taken to adjust your perception.

This paper explores the paradox of seeking happiness in a world rife with suffering, proposing actionable strategies to balance realism with optimism.

## 2.0 Background

This section describes the empirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its validity, the range of different ways the pattern can be manifested in a dialog, and so on.


## 2.1 Background #1: There is plenty of Good News

To Eloise and David, I tried to point out the good things that are happening in the world. The lives of people all over the world is better than what they when I was young. I talked about housing, food, healthcare. [Of course, none of this countered that fact that there still is a lot of suffering in the world. And that the future may be worse than the present.]

I am not the only one to feel some optimism about the the current situation. For example, here is NY Times columnist Paul Krugman's take on the current US economic situation.

* https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/opinion/economy-crime-presidential-election.html

>You may have heard about the good economic news. Labor force participation — the share of adults in today’s work force — is actually slightly higher than the Congressional Budget Office predicted before the pandemic. Measures of underlying inflation have fallen more or less back to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target even though unemployment is near a 50-year low. Adjusted for inflation, most workers’ wages have gone up.
>
>For some reason I’ve heard less about the crime news, but it’s also remarkably good. F.B.I. data shows that violent crime has subsided: It’s already back to 2019 levels and appears to be falling further. Homicides probably aren’t quite back to 2019 levels, but they’re plummeting.

As we shall see, my efforts to list all manner of happy things were doomed to failure. But I have learned a lot in the process - as you shall see.


## 2.1 All it takes is: One Bad Apple

The problem with the listing all good news items is that it only takes a single counter example to mess things up. For example:

* Is it OK if in a group of people that only one person is a murderer?
* Would you like to fly in an airplane with a hundred windows with only a single window that could pop out?
* Is it OK to have a world where most people are OK, but there's always some who have to suffer?

Of course not. All it takes is "one bad apple" and your premise is _kaput_.

>The bad apples metaphor originated as a warning of the corrupting influence of one corrupt or sinful person on a group: that "one bad apple can spoil the barrel".

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias?


## 2.2 Question: How many good experiences finally outweigh a bad one?

The idea that a number of good experiences could outweigh a bad one does not work in this case because we are discussing deep human suffering. For example: a million nice experiences cannot compensate for the wrongful death a single human.

## 2.3 Background #2: The Bad News

In the Krugman article mentioned above, he also understands the pessimism. He points to the negative economic sentiment index: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT

Here is another take on negative sentiment:

* https://stevestewartwilliams.substack.com/p/graph-of-the-day-politics-and-teen

> Rates of mental illness among teenagers have increased dramatically over the last decade, with a particularly steep increase among teenage girls.

Pessimism is everywhere! Why?


## 3.0 Analysis

## 3.1 Negativity Bias

Here's a reason why there is so much pessimism! Having a good "negativity bias" is a survival trait. It is a good thing.

Links of interest

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias

>The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, is a cognitive bias that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things. In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative. The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations.

>Bad experiences affect us much more powerfully than good ones, but there are ways to deal with this destructive bias and overcome it

## 3.2 "If it bleeds, it leads"

The news media is a business. The news media are in the business of pandering to your negativity bias.

* https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads

>A basic fact in the news media is that, if a story involves a brutal death or injury of some kind (or the likelihood of it), it is likely to get higher ratings. The more lurid the story, the better its chances of being the ratings leader.

* https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/two-takes-depression/201106/if-it-bleeds-it-leads-understanding-fear-based-media

>_Managing depression requires you to mind your media intake_
>
>Fear-based news stories prey on the anxieties we all have and then hold us hostage. Being glued to the television, reading the paper, or surfing the Internet increases ratings and market shares — but it also raises the probability of depression relapse.

* https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/506947-news-industrys-bleeding-leads-good-for-business-bad-for-the-country/

>Crime stories ask nothing of us. They are emotion-based only. Like a good horror movie, they play with your sense of fear and keep you engaged until the monster is trapped and the end-credits roll. Too many newsrooms are just like movie studios, serving up new monsters, fresh sequels, to make sure you don’t change the channel or cancel your subscription.


## 3.3 Anna Karenina principle

It's not just the news media. Negativity bias is everywhere. It's in all the best fiction you can read!

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle

> The Anna Karenina principle states that a deficiency in any one of a number of factors dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one for which every possible deficiency has been avoided.
>
>The name of the principle derives from Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel Anna Karenina, which begins:
>
>"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."


## 3.4 Further research is needed

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_research_is_needed
>The phrases "further research is needed" (FRIN), "more research is needed" and other variants are commonly used in research papers. The cliché is so common that it has attracted research, regulation and cultural commentary.

Personally, I feel that "Further research is needed" is indicative of some type of negativity bias. Of course, in order to determine the validity of the assertion, further research is needed.


## 4.0 Looking for solutions

## 4.1 Negative Visualization

_Question: If negativity bias is a thing, then how can you use it to your advantage?_

Even while talking to Eloise and David, I was aware that I was not offering a good response to their pessimism. They know about al the good things as much as I do. Where we differ is where and how we give weight or emphasis to all good things and bad things that are happening.

A few days later I came across the article below. It offers an alternative way of thinking about the world called negative visualization. \<ai>It is a technique that the Stoics used to help them appreciate the good things in their lives. It is a technique that I have used for many years. I did not know that it had a name.\</ai>


Links of interest

* https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-cultures/202401/5-strategies-for-flourishing-from-the-stoic-pharmacy

>For a few seconds, allow yourself to contemplate how, at this very moment, things could be worse. You could be suffering from a toothache. Your friends could abandon you. Your computer could break, erasing your work. In an instant, the cornerstones for joy and meaning in your life (your health, your relationships, your accomplishments) could go awry in an infinite number of ways. Dismal as it may sound, the Stoics used negative visualization to kindle profound appreciation for the life that they did have. According to Irvine, this practice has the potential to “transform us into individuals who are delighted to be alive.” After all, “the fact that there are so many bad things that aren’t happening is a cause for celebration in itself.”

* https://mindfulnessbox.com/negative-visualization-benefits/

>Negative visualization is the practice of imagining worst-case scenarios, popularized by the Stoics of ancient Rome. Negative visualization exercises can help you be grateful for what you have and appreciate the shortness of life.


## 4.2 My take on negative visualization

I feel that I am a "frequent flyer" with negative visualization. Some examples:

I am disabled. I am partially paralyzed, and my left hand was amputated. I could not dream of running a mile or playing in a tennis match or of the innumerable things people do to find happiness.

Nonetheless I am really glad that I still have my right hand. I find that it was really lucky that the only muscle on my left foot is the one that prevents "drop-foot" which means that you have to have special shoes to prevent you from tripping.

I spent over ten years learning to be not a terribly good architect but the architectural skills I acquired became useful when I started to write software for the construction industry.

Unlike my parents' acrimonious divorce, my separation from my wife has been amicable and respectful. I am very grateful for that.

I establish my personal gratitude and happiness out of all the bad things that have happened to me. This has allowed me to disengage my own personal suffering from the suffering of others. I can feel compassion for others without feeling that I am suffering myself.

## Negative visualizations of negative biases

What I seem to be doing is creating a negative visualization or opposite of a negative bias. I am looking at a bad thing

### 4.3 Question: Where to draw the line?

Suffering is everywhere. Do I have to to a negative visualization on all of it?
For example: How many bugs have I killed each time I walk across a lawn? Do I have to think "Ha ha, I'm alive and you're not?"

Or do I have to think as I go out to a fancy restaurant, "How many lives could I save if I donated all the money to causes that treat malaria?"

Where does self-interest end and altruism begin?

### 4.3.1 My take on where to draw the line

The number of things I can do to alleviate the suffering of others is limited. \<ai>I can donate money to charities. I can volunteer. I can vote for politicians who will help the poor. I can write letters to politicians. I can write articles like this one. I can talk to people. I can be kind to people. I can be kind to myself. I can be kind to Eloise and David. I can be kind to my family. I can be kind to my friends. I can be kind to strangers. I can be kind to myself.\</ai>

I keep my boundaries as close as possible to myself. I cannot save the world.


## 4.4 I care therefor I am

_I'm not sure where this aside fits in with suffering and pessimism and happiness. But I like it._

This is my current favorite quote: "I care therefore I am." I made it up in some online chat.

Just because I cannot save the world does not mean that I do not care.

I heard the following prayer so often in six years at SPS that begin to that I begin to believe it. ;-)

* Saint Paul’s School ~ The School Prayer ~ https://www.sps.edu/living/chapel-program

>"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.



## 4.5 Wandering Attention

_Another aside that I am not sure where it fits in._

I can be thinking of all the suffering in South Sudan, for example, and the next second be thinking about what I am going to be having for dinner then thinking about whether the any crawling on the windowsill will ever find its way home.

Concentrating on a topic implies caring about it. But my mind wanders. I simply cannot care about the Rohingya people in Burma - and many others - 24/7. So it goes. It's OK.

## 5.0 But ~ Other considerations

In the book _A Patten Language_, one of the things you must do is link to similar patterns. This is a good idea. It helps you to see the connections between the various patterns.


## 5.1 Similar patterns

* **Hope for the best, prepare for the worst** Anticipating future negative events can lessen the blow if and when they happen
* **Understand risks so you’re not blindsided by reality** Much of our hardships come from adapting to the new reality of a negative event




## 7.0 Conclusion

Finding happiness and joy, expressing gratitude, creating beauty, seeking security and safety, and being kind to others are all worthy human endeavors. They are all choices that we can make.

Achievement of these is helped immensely by assiduously avoiding pessimism and negativity while at the same time being aware of the suffering of others and accepting who we are and what we can do.

## Apendix 1~  Question: Why have Children

In many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries, there is a trend where lower socio-economic groups tend to have higher fertility rates compared to those in higher socio-economic groups. On the other hand, individuals with substantial wealth may find it more feasible to have children, given their ability to manage the associated financial responsibilities more comfortably. Not having children is what educated, selfless middle-class people do.

## Appendix 2 ~ Question: Is it OK to be happy in a world of where there is suffering?

Bing AI responded:

Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you asked this question, as it shows that you care about others and have a sense of empathy. 😊

There is no definitive answer to this question, as different people may have different views on happiness, suffering, and morality. However, some possible ways to approach this question are:

* Happiness is not a zero-sum game. Being happy does not mean that you are taking away happiness from others, or that you are ignoring their suffering. On the contrary, being happy can help you to be more compassionate, generous, and resilient, and to spread positive emotions to others. Happiness can also motivate you to take action to alleviate suffering, such as by donating, volunteering, or advocating for a cause. As the Dalai Lama said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."¹
* Happiness is a natural and healthy human emotion. It is not something that you should feel guilty or ashamed of, even when others are suffering. Happiness is not a sign of selfishness or indifference, but of gratitude and appreciation for the good things in life. Happiness can also help you to cope with stress, adversity, and challenges, and to prevent or reduce negative emotions such as anger, anxiety, and depression. Happiness can also boost your physical health, immune system, and longevity. As the philosopher Bertrand Russell said, "The happiness that is genuinely satisfying is accompanied by the fullest exercise of our faculties and the fullest realization of the world in which we live."²
* Happiness is a choice and a skill. It is not something that depends on external circumstances, but on your inner attitude and perspective. You can choose to be happy, regardless of what is happening in the world, by focusing on the things that you can control, such as your thoughts, feelings, and actions. You can also cultivate happiness by practicing habits and activities that enhance your well-being, such as meditation, gratitude, kindness, optimism, and social connection. Happiness is not a fixed state, but a dynamic and flexible process that you can learn and improve. As the psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky said, "Happiness is not out there for us to find. The reason that it’s not out there is that it’s inside us."³

I hope this helps you to think about this question and to find your own answer. Remember, happiness is not a luxury, but a necessity. It is not a privilege, but a right. It is not a reward, but a duty. And it is not a problem, but a solution. 🌟
