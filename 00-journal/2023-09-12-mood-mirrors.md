## Introduction

My daughter Alix asks: "What can you do with this prompt?"

### Prompt Variables
Color
Shape
Music
Pattern
Vibrations

### Example #1
Today I would describe my energy color as pastel pinks and purples, with shapes similar to soft clouds, floating, the speed of the energy is slow and the music that would resemble it is slow classical piano.

### Example #2
My Energy has a color which is dark purple, with shapes of very sharp triangles. The movement of the energy is very fast, the music style  that would resemble it is heavy metal.

## Investigation



## Chirp 1

From this link I found Chirp: https://substack.com/inbox/post/136716557

Chirp is a text-to-music model developed by Suno.

You can paste in your own lyrics or have ChatGPT to generate them behind the scenes, as I did above. Shortly after that, Chirp will write out the lyrics. And a while after that, you’ll get your finished track:

### Prompt 1

My Energy has a color which is dark purple, with shapes of very sharp triangles. The movement of the energy is very fast, the music style  that would resemble it is heavy metal.

### Chirp Generated Text 1

[verse]
My energy has a color, dark purple it may be
Sharp triangles shape the essence flowing free
With speed and might, it's a force without fear
In heavy metal, its music is clear

[chorus]
Dark purple energy, sharp triangles ride
Fast movement through time, no one can hide
Heavy metal roar, as the power takes hold
In this world of darkness, my energy unfolds
Style of Music
random

### Chirp Generated Text 2

[Verse]
Today, my energy's hues shine bright
Pastel pinks and purples, soft and light
Like drifting clouds, I gracefully soar
A gentle breeze, slow, forevermore

In this world of calm, my spirit roams
Through melodies on keys, my energy flows
In shades of pinks and purples, I find peace
With slow-paced piano, all worries cease

### Observations

Chirp is easy, fast and free. It was a great way to get started. I will use again, but I have no idea about the competition.

### Observations

I hade to create a video for Jupiterr to work from.

User experience was not intuitive. End product was bases on stock photos.

I will skip this one next tome.

### Generated Script

Today, I want to take you on a journey through the calming world of contemporary classical music. Picture yourself in a serene space, surrounded by soft pastel hues of pinks and purples, like a warm sunset painting the sky. As the melody starts, it's as if you're floating on a cloud, effortlessly carried by a gentle breeze. The slow-paced piano chords resonate with the rhythm of your heart, inviting you to let go of any worries that may be weighing you down. In this tranquil place, where energy flows through delicate keystrokes, you'll find solace and inner peace. So let's dive into the realm of soothing piano melodies, where tranquility awaits.

### Kapwing Observations

Kapwing offers what looks like to be a full set of tools for creating videos. I may explore this further in the future.

The generated script feature looks likely it be useful. The only drawback was that on my first and only run it used stock images and no music.


## RunwayML

### Text to Video Observations

Video was boring, so I decided to add and image.

## MidJourney

Used MidJourney to create an add an image to the video.

### Prompt MJ

All OK, flowers on keyboard kind of odd. Selected the "pretty" top right image to continue..

### Runway Video

Used the Midjourney image and the Chirp lyrics as the text to create a video in Runway.

https://app.runwayml.com/creation/8302eb43-ddb1-4c5f-809e-bcc403401d5b

I probably could have used Runay to add the audio but that seemed complicated.

## ClipChamp > final effort

I used the Microsoft Windows app ClipChamp to combine the Chirp audio and the Runway video.

* Combine Runway and Chirp files using Windows Clipchamp
* Upload to YouTube

See the video here

## Conclusion

Chirp, MidJourney and Runway are all interesting tools. They work well with each other. All are fast, easy and free. I will use them again.
