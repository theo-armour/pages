# Track the Right Metrics

If the SDG are to be achieved and maintained it wil be because

* SDGs make life easier, simpler and more fun

When complying takes more time, costs more money, or requires mor skills than non-compliance will prevail

* SDGs must offer a path of less resistance

But the only way to know that you are complying is to have the right targets and metrics.

That generally means keeping track of much more data than ever before. This can mean adding more spreadsheets, more databases, more reports, more meetings, more people, more time, more money.

A primary goal of the SDG Toolkit is to help you track the right metrics with the least amount of effort.

A first task of the SDG startup team is to identify al the current metrics and reporting that is already being carried to monitor the company's current performance. Spreadsheet, databases, reports, worksheets may all be useful.

The first goal is to identify the metrics that are already being tracked that are already relevant to the SDGs.

The second goal is to identify the metrics where an extra column in a spreadsheet or an extra field in a database calculated from existing columns or files might provide useful metrics.

The third goal is to identify the metrics that are not currently being tracked but that would be useful to track. The essential goal here will be to identify a new priece of hardware or a new software program that will gather the data with human intervention

The overarching goal: We are measuring our progress towards the SDGs and we are doing so with the least amount of effort. Nobody has had to change the way they work. Nobody has had to learn a new skill. Nobody - apart from the setup effort has to spend more time or money.

## Example

In order to comply with SDG 3 "Good health and well being", the organization supplies fitness trackers such as Apple Watches, FitBits or similar) to all employees. The fitness trackers are linked to a database that tracks and anonymizes the number of steps taken by each employee. The database is linked to a spreadsheet that calculates the average number of steps taken by all employees. The spreadsheet is linked to a report that maintained on the website. Fingers crossed: after a few years, the number of work day lost to illness has dropped by 10% and the number of steps taken by employees has increased by 10%. The company is now in a position to claim that it is complying with SDG 3.

* Tracking and reducing the number of trash bins emptied each week and report on the dashboard
* Using employee home addresses, identify situations where rather than paying for an employee car parking space, the company pays for employee bus passes or scooter hire
* Identify ways that time sheets may be used to monitor and reduce gender inequalities
