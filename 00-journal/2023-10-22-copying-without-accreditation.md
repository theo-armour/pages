# 2023-10-22 Copying without Accreditation

tags #ai #copyright #law #plagiarism #writing

We often think that AI is copying without accreditation. But we do it all the time. Open a copy of the New York Times, the Encyclopedia Britannica, or a book from the library. You will find that the author has copied ideas, styles and points of view and more without accreditation.

If we are to push AI to respect its sources, then we should push ourselves to respect our sources.
