Messaging can take many forms, including advertising, public relations, social media, and political campaigns. It is an important tool for politicians, businesses, and organizations to communicate with their target audience and achieve their goals.


## Messaging: Me

### Conjecture: Dems: Exclude ~ Reps: Include ~ Others: ??

Dems message: blacks, women, hispanic, gay, disabled

* Each "identity" one tends to ignore or even exclude or even cast blame on the "other side"
* Thus. he more groupings one belongs to the smaller the number the cohort. Many people may be Black but fewer identify as gay AND black AND a women.

Reps message: NASCAR, local football teams ("Rams"), Denominations ("Southern Baptist"), Individual pod-casters ("Rogan")

* Each grouping is additive. The more groups one belongs to the larger the cohort.
* Thus, the number in the cohort of Southern Baptists is large, but the number of people who are Southern Baptist OR NASCAR or Dodgers supporters is huge
