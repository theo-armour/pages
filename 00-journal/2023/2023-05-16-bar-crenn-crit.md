Bar Crenn

No menu therefore no text therefore hard to describe

Food, service, interior design, music, ambiance: all as anticipated

I'm no stranger, know the drill, the drill was executed as expected

I anticipated taking photos of each course and writing down the ingredients but I ended up being too busy enjoying the moment and being with myself

Was it worth it?

Yes, because I went by myself and the only thing speaking to me was the dining experience

If I had been with someone else, I would have been enmeshed in the conversation. If the dialogue is good then that transcends the food. If the dialogue is not so fun then the food is a distraction.

New understanding #1 -

I am not a foodie. I am a restaurantie. I like the restaurant experience. I like the food. I like the wine. I like the music. I like the staff. I like the room. I like the moment.

When we go to the theater, opera, ballet or any performance, we are not allowed to talk. We are not allowed to take photos. We are not allowed to use our phones. We are not allowed to eat. We are not allowed to drink. We are not allowed to smoke. We are not allowed to do anything but sit there and watch the performance.

Why is it that we are allowed to talk, take photos, use our phones, eat, drink, smoke and do anything but sit there and watch the performance when we go to a restaurant?

I think it is because we are not used to going to restaurants that are performances. We are used to going to restaurants that are places to eat. We are used to going to restaurants that are places to talk. We are used to going to restaurants that are places to drink. We are used to going to restaurants that are places to smoke. We are used to going to restaurants that are places to do anything but sit there and watch the performance.

So in going by myself, I was able to sit there and watch the performance. I was able to be in the moment. I was able to be with myself. I was able to be with the food. I was able to be with the wine. I was able to be with the music. I was able to be with the staff. I was able to be with the room. I was able to be with the moment.

Thus the experience was worth every penny.

I will go back.

I will go back by myself.

And I will go back with my friend Mercedes. Mercedes heard about my adventure. She is a foodie  and she wants to go.

I will go back with Mercedes and we will sit there and watch the performance.

And we will be in the moment.


## New Understanding #2

You have seen and heard the finest singers performing the finest songs. You have seen and heard the finest musicians performing the finest music. You have seen and heard the finest dancers performing the finest dances. You have seen and heard the finest actors performing the finest plays. Through the miracle of print and video, the reproduction of performances of the best artists are available to all worldwide at negligible cost.

But the meals of the finest chefs creating the finest meals? Not so likely. The finest chefs creating the finest meals are available to a few at a very high cost.

For sure there is  a difference between a live performance and a reproduction. Looking at a photograph of the "Mona Lisa" is not the same as looking at the "Mona Lisa" in the Louvre. Listening to a recording of "La Boheme" is not the same as listening to "La Boheme" at the Met. Watching a video of "Swan Lake" is not the same as watching "Swan Lake" at the Bolshoi. Reading a book is not the same as seeing the play. Watching a video of a chef preparing a meal is not the same as eating the meal prepared by the chef.

But the difference between a live performance and a reproduction is not as great as the difference between a live performance and no performance. Within five minutes walk of Crenn there are some very good dining spots ~ Balboa Cafe is almost next door, for example. But the difference between Balboa Cafe and Crenn is may be as great as the difference between a live performance and no performance. A symphony orchestra and a jazz trio both play music. If you went to one but got the other, the result may be anger rather than pleasure.


You can have a great meal that is cheap, but not at a fancy-pants restaurant. You can have a bad meal at a great restaurant. A truly great meal at a great restaurant is a performance that is virtually irreproducible and extremely expensive. What other aspects of life are similar?

There was much circular discussion, but I could not get chat to be able to state the understanding I was looking for. It did come up with "once in a lifetime" and "serendipitous" - which are closely allied thoughts if somehow the notions of art and creativity and performance could be included.

_A meal prepared by the finest chef at one of the best restaurants is a performance that is virtually irreproducible. What other aspects of life are similar?_

There are several aspects of life that share the characteristic of being virtually irreproducible, similar to a meal prepared by a top chef. Here are a few examples:

1. Live Performances: Whether it's a theater play, a musical concert, or a dance performance, the experience of witnessing a live performance is unique and difficult to replicate. Each performance is influenced by the energy of the audience, the chemistry between performers, and the spontaneous moments that occur in real-time. Even if the same play or concert is performed multiple times, each instance will have its own distinct atmosphere and nuances.

2. Sporting Events: Watching a live sporting event, especially at a professional level, offers a sense of excitement and unpredictability that is difficult to recreate. The competitiveness, skill, and physicality of the athletes, coupled with the emotions of the spectators, create an atmosphere that cannot be replicated. Each game or match has its own set of circumstances, strategies, and moments of brilliance, making it a one-of-a-kind experience.

3. Natural Phenomena: Witnessing certain natural phenomena, such as a breathtaking sunset, a rare celestial event like a meteor shower, or the majesty of a waterfall, is a fleeting and unrepeatable experience. These moments are influenced by ever-changing environmental factors, weather conditions, and personal perspectives, making them unique to the time and place they occur.

4. Personal Connections: The connections we form with others, whether it's friendships, romantic relationships, or familial bonds, are deeply personal and often irreplaceable. Each relationship is built upon a unique set of shared experiences, memories, and emotions that cannot be replicated. The dynamics between individuals, their personalities, and the circumstances that brought them together contribute to the distinct nature of these connections.

5. Travel and Exploration: Exploring new places and cultures can offer enriching experiences that are difficult to reproduce. The combination of unfamiliar surroundings, diverse landscapes, local traditions, and chance encounters with new people all contribute to the uniqueness of each travel experience. No matter how well-documented a destination may be, the personal interactions and discoveries made during travel make it an individualized adventure.

These examples highlight aspects of life that, like a meal prepared by a top chef, are characterized by their irreplicability and the inherent value of being present in the moment to fully appreciate them.

_Ok, but most of your suggestions can be recorded and replayed. You can't "record" a meal._

You're right, the examples I provided can be recorded or documented to some extent, allowing us to revisit them in various forms. However, the essence and full experience of those moments can often be difficult to capture or replicate completely. While recordings, photographs, or descriptions can help evoke memories or provide a glimpse into past experiences, they may not fully capture the sensory aspects, emotions, and atmosphere that make those moments special.

In the case of a meal prepared by a top chef, while you cannot recreate the exact same meal once it has been consumed, you can certainly document the experience through descriptions, photographs, or reviews. However, the subtle interplay of flavors, aromas, textures, and presentation, along with the ambiance of the restaurant and the personalized service, can be challenging to replicate or convey fully through any medium.

Similarly, while recordings or documentation can offer a glimpse into live performances, sporting events, natural phenomena, personal connections, and travel experiences, they often cannot capture the complete essence and the feeling of being present in the moment.

In summary, while recordings and documentation can serve as a form of preservation and allow us to relive certain aspects of these experiences, they often fall short of fully reproducing the richness and uniqueness of the original moments. The true value lies in the ephemeral nature of these experiences, encouraging us to cherish and embrace the present when they occur.

_What about the cost of replicating the experiences?  Sunsets are free; restaurants are not._

ChatGPT
You raise a valid point regarding the cost associated with replicating certain experiences. While natural phenomena like sunsets are freely accessible, other experiences, such as dining at a high-end restaurant, often come with a significant financial investment.

The cost factor plays a role in the exclusivity and perceived value of certain experiences. It is true that not everyone can afford to visit expensive restaurants or attend high-profile events regularly. The price tag attached to these experiences can contribute to their desirability and the perception of them being special or luxurious.

On the other hand, the accessibility of some experiences, such as watching a sunset or enjoying a walk in nature, can make them more universally available and egalitarian. They provide opportunities for moments of beauty and awe without requiring financial resources.

However, it's important to note that the cost of an experience doesn't solely determine its uniqueness or irreplicability. As mentioned earlier, even if the cost of a meal at a fine restaurant could be afforded multiple times, each visit would still offer a distinct experience due to factors like the ever-changing menu, seasonal ingredients, evolving culinary techniques, and the artistic interpretation of the chef.

In summary, the cost associated with replicating certain experiences can contribute to their exclusivity, but it does not negate their irreplicability or the value they hold for those who can access and appreciate them. Meanwhile, the accessibility of other experiences, despite being cost-free, can still offer their own unique and memorable qualities.

_You can have a great meal that is cheap, but not at a fancy-pants restaurant. You can have a bad meal at a great restaurant. A truly great meal at a great restaurant is a performance that is virtually irreproducible and extremely expensive. What other aspects of life are similar?_

ChatGPT
You are correct, having a great meal doesn't necessarily require dining at an expensive or fancy restaurant. Exceptional dining experiences can be found at various price points and in different settings. Conversely, dining at a high-end restaurant doesn't guarantee a great meal. The quality of the food, service, and overall experience can vary.

Expanding on the idea of irreproducible and expensive experiences, here are some other aspects of life that share similar characteristics:

Fine Art: Owning or experiencing a masterpiece created by a renowned artist is often an expensive endeavor. Original works of art can be unique and one-of-a-kind, making them highly valuable and irreplicable. The combination of the artist's skill, vision, and the historical context in which the artwork was created contributes to its rarity and the cost associated with it.

Luxury Travel Experiences: Certain travel experiences, such as staying at exclusive resorts, embarking on private yacht trips, or accessing remote destinations, can be extremely expensive and difficult to replicate. The level of personalized service, privacy, and unique amenities provided in these luxury experiences sets them apart and makes them sought after by those who can afford them.

High-end Fashion: Fashion items created by renowned designers and luxury brands often come with a high price tag. These pieces are crafted with attention to detail, high-quality materials, and often limited production runs. The exclusivity, craftsmanship, and reputation associated with luxury fashion contribute to the perceived value and difficulty of replicating such items.

Exclusive Events and Galas: Attending prestigious events, such as high-profile award ceremonies, charity galas, or fashion shows, can be both expensive and difficult to replicate. These events offer unique opportunities to engage with prominent figures, experience exceptional performances, and be part of an exclusive gathering that is typically reserved for a select few.

Collectibles and Rare Items: Collecting rare and valuable items, such as limited-edition luxury goods, vintage wines, or unique memorabilia, can be an expensive pursuit. The rarity, historical significance, or cultural importance of these items contributes to their high value and difficulty in reproducing them exactly.

In all these examples, the combination of exceptional quality, exclusivity, and the investment of resources contributes to the perception that the experiences or items are virtually irreproducible. The cost associated with them often serves as a barrier to access, adding to their desirability and uniqueness.

_A great chef in preparing a fine meal is the performance an artist creating a work of art. The phenomena you mention are rarely themselves performative or artistic._
