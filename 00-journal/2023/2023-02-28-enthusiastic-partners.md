# Enthusiastic Partners

Let's say I have read a book that you have read and like, you ask me about it, and I say "it sucks. I never finished it". This is an outcome that is not infrequent. We would both accept it and move on.

Now let's say I have read a book that you are in the process of writing, you ask me about it, and I say "it sucks. I never finished it". You probably be surprised and feel hurt.

Providing feedback on a work-in-progress requires a different thought process than commenting on a finished product

Using something not the same as creating something. Examples include:

* Reading a book is not the same as writing book
* Living in a building is not the same as designing a building
* Looking at a painting is not the same as painting.
* Watching a movie is not the same as editing the movie
* Being a student of whatever is not the same as being a teacher of whatever

Even if the activities are different we tend to use the same tools to comment and criticize the work being created as we use for the work being used.

A finished work used by many should be open for discussion. Failures need to be pointed out. Imperfections need to be highlighted. These flaws should be shared among users quickly and seamlessly until even better things are produced. This is the way things have been improved over the millennia all over the globe.

The more brutally honest you are the better. Pointing out even the tiniest flaw in an indication of insight. Even if the person who created the work is present, there are no feelings to hurt deeply because you comments will be the next version be better.

When you confront a work being created, the natural thing is to follow these same rules of discussing the things we use everyday. And there may be issues in doing so.

Similarly if you talk to a doctor or a police offices or teacher, you can discuss and criticize their profession and even - to a certain extent - their duties and obligations in that field.

On the other hand, when you are talking to students not yet practicing a profession you tend to act and talk in a manner that is quite different to the way you will talk to them a few years later when they are have started to actually to practice their trade. You are more likely to say "doctors are great" tp as medical student and to say "doctors suck" to a practicing doctor

We need to look at the work-in-progress and the work-in-use in different ways.

There is only one work-in-use but the work-in-progress has infinite outcomes.

There are an infinite number of ways to edit a film but there is only one "[Director's cut]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director%27s_cut )".

A finished work is a single outcome a work in progress has infinite outcomes. Using the same terminology to discuss both is what happens most often but is not the best way.

Since the work is unfinished

* you are not seeing all the work
* You are seeing just one of many possibilities
* You may be seeing a dead end
* You are seeing a host of imperfections because time has not been spent doing a final cleanup

While the work is still in the being built the author, artist, designer is in a precarious state

A work that is not finished is indefensible. A work that is not finished has no value (or very little value) or meaning. In the same way that an unlicensed student cannot even be a partial licensed practitioner or a half-baked is just not a cake.

If you want to talk to a student or to a designer it helps if you look at the work from their point of view

Below are links to two articles that I believe begin to point out good strategies.

They begin to crystalize some of the thoughts I had while raising three daughters. My simplistic rule was always to

* Offer unconditional love
* Be a backer for any endeavor they were involved with
* Offer suggestions as to courses or activities or opportunities that seemed to fit the personality of the daughter at the time
* Do my best not impose pre-conceived notions of where they should be or do
* Handover over money, health and other life management skills early in life
* Never be a naysayer


The articles add

* When someone is asking you questions, they are interested in your thought process and perhaps your idea, but what’s more important is that they are forcing you to think about things you maybe have not
* “Enthusiastic Participation” (EP).
* When you come across people who are Enthusiastic EP in your life, they are valuable.
* They help you understand what you really want.

> Find someone who shows Enthusiastic Participation for you. They may come in the form of someone who pushes you to be honest, pushes you to understand your limitations or challenges you to not listen to others who have no idea who you really are. They will be that person who asks you things that are hard to answer. Things you are not comfortable answering. They also may come to you with a limitless desire to help you be a better you. Will you know them when they come across your path? I hope so.
