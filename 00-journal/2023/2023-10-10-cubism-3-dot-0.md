> A Times critic argues that ours is the least innovative century for the arts in 500 years. That doesn’t have to be a bad thing

We can do better. This post is a first pass at outlining a process.

## Cubism history

Picasso painted les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. It was a radical departure from the art of the day. It was the beginning of Cubism.

Cubism 2.0 is all the derivative stuff that followed

Cubism 3.0 is what will be proposed.

## It starts with: __Les Demoiselles d'Avignon__

It all starts with Picasso's __Les Demoiselles d'Avignon__.

See my post written on the 100th anniversary of the painting:

Further posts by me will delineate visible aspects of the painting that few if any critics have commented on that may be highly relevant to Cubism 3.0.

## What are the Principles of Cubism?

### Result #1

Cubism is a revolutionary art movement that emerged in the early 20th century, primarily developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The principles of Cubism include:

1. **Geometric Simplification**: Objects and figures in Cubist paintings are broken down into geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders.

2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, Cubist artists portrayed the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.

3. **Abstract Representation**: Cubism often abstracts the forms of the subjects, breaking them down into geometric shapes and reassembling them in a fragmented manner.

4. **Interplay of Light and Plane**: Cubists explored the interplay of light and plane, using shading and color to give depth to flat surfaces.

5. **Overlap and Transparency**: Objects and backgrounds might overlap, and objects might be transparent, allowing the viewer to see through them.

6. **Reduction to Basic Shapes**: Everything is reduced to basic geometric shapes, eliminating unnecessary details.

7. **Collage Elements**: Some Cubist works incorporate mixed media and collage elements, blending painting with other materials.

8. **Limited Color Palette**: Early Cubist paintings often had a restricted color palette, with artists using neutral colors and earth tones.

9. **Emphasis on Structure**: The structural quality of the object is emphasized over its surroundings.

10. **Rejection of Traditional Techniques**: Cubists rejected the traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening.

These principles allowed Cubists to explore objects and figures in an innovative way, breaking them down and viewing them from multiple angles simultaneously. The movement had a profound impact on modern art, influencing many subsequent art movements and artists.

### Result #2

Cubism is a revolutionary modern art movement that emerged in the early 20th century. Here are some key principles of Cubism:

1. **Multiple Perspectives**: One of the most distinctive characteristics of Cubism is the application of multiple perspectives in a single artwork. Instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, Cubist artists showcased multiple facets of the object simultaneously.

2. **Geometric Shapes**: Cubism is known for breaking down objects into geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, and cones. These fragmented forms are then reassembled to create the final composition.

3. **Flatness of the Picture Plane**: Traditional techniques of perspective and depth were rejected in Cubism. Instead, the style emphasized the flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane.

4. **Monochromatic Color Palette**: Early Cubist artworks often employed a restricted color palette, primarily using shades of brown, gray, and green. This helped to focus on the structure and form of the objects rather than their color.

5. **Abstraction**: As Cubism evolved, the compositions became increasingly abstract, moving further away from representational art.

6. **Deconstruction and Reassembly**: Objects in Cubist artworks are deconstructed into their basic geometric components and then reassembled in a way that might not be true to their real-world appearance but offers a more conceptual understanding of their essence.

These principles were pioneered by artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque and marked a significant departure from traditional art forms, leading to a broader exploration of abstract art in the 20th century.

## Basic points of Cubism Summarized

Gathering all sixteen items from the two above lists, we have the following basic points of Cubism 1.0:

* Multiple Perspectives (x2)
* Monochromatic Color Palette ~ Limited Color Palette
* Geometric Simplification ~ Reduction to Basic Shape
* Geometric Shapes ~ Emphasis on Structure
* Abstract Representation ~ Abstraction
* Interplay of Light and Plane ~ Flatness of the Picture Plane
* Overlap and Transparency ~ Collage Elements ~ Deconstruction and Reassembly
* Rejection of Traditional Techniques


### Basic points of Cubism 3.0

If Cubism 3.0 is to be interesting, it must have the ability to turn the above list on its head and inside out. Here is a first attempt:

* Cubism: Multiple Perspectives (x2) || 3.0: multiple Viewpoints
* Cubism: Monochromatic Color Palette ~ Limited Color Palette || 3.0: billions of colors
* Cubism: Geometric Simplification ~ Reduction to Basic Shape = reductionism || 3.0: holism
* Cubism: Geometric Shapes ~ Emphasis on Structure || 3.0: emphasis on process
* Cubism: Abstract Representation ~ Abstraction = Plato || 3.0: concretization or specialization = Aristotle
* Cubism: Interplay of Light and Plane ~ Flatness of the Picture Plane || 3.0: Interplay of Darkness and Volume ~ multidimensionality of the picture plane ~ multiple isolations or exclusions
* Cubism: Overlap and Transparency ~ Collage Elements ~ Deconstruction and Reassembly || 3.0: "Synthesis and Integration" or "Consolidation and Unification"
* Cubism: Rejection of Traditional Techniques || 3.0: Disruption/Remix of Traditional Techniques

All of these points and more will be outlined and detailed in future posts. And these, in turn, with your help lead to the Manifesto of Cubism 3.0.

In order to create  "Basic points of Cubism 3.0" the following searches were made using Bing:

## opposite of reductionism

The opposite of reductionism is **holism**¹. Reductionism is the approach that breaks down complex systems into their individual components for understanding, while holism emphasizes understanding the system as a whole¹. Holism posits that the properties of a system cannot be explained solely in terms of its constituent parts and their interactions¹.

There are two forms of antireductionism or holism:
1. **Epistemological antireductionism** holds that we simply are not capable of understanding systems at the level of their most basic constituents, and so the program of reductionism must fail¹.
2. **Ontological antireductionism** holds that such a complete explanation in terms of basic constituents is not possible even in principle for some systems¹.

In disciplines such as cybernetics and systems theory, a non-reductionist view of science is embraced, sometimes explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, which is, in a sense, the opposite of a reductionist approach¹.

## opposite of Abstraction

The opposite of abstraction is **concretization**⁵ or **specialization**⁵. Abstraction is the process of considering something independently of its associations, attributes, or concrete accompaniments¹. On the other hand, concretization refers to making something concrete, specific, or definite⁵, and specialization refers to focusing on a specific aspect or feature⁵.

## Opposite of "Interplay of Light and Plane"

The phrase "Interplay of Light and Plane" refers to the interaction between light and a flat surface or plane. The opposite could be considered as the "Interplay of Darkness and Volume", which would refer to the interaction between darkness or absence of light and a three-dimensional space. This is an abstract concept and can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context.
