Socrates ~ selfie only onself

slides too small

Why so much fuss

chatbots

turing test ~ chatbots pass the test

science fiction to reality

LLM ~ study and learn ~ NLP

* GoFAI ~ good fashioned AI ~ too brittle ~ too indeterminate
* dispersed neural network computing
* Model on human brain
* distinguish cat and dogs
* predicting next best word
* not thinking ~ using NLL
* As transformative as fire and electricity
* "ultra intelligent machines" will be the last machines we invent. -: i g good
* Purely feed forward ~ remarkably cogent
* We don't really understand
* Like a child ~ does the unpredictable
* Hallucinates
* It's all computation
* Like brain ~ we don't understand
* Convincing
* Humans leaving dates for chatbots ~ rewards without cost
* Humans: Ontological undetndings ~ simplify
* AI: Parasitic
* May liz: AGI
* Robots can't do things >> did not get the LLM and robots connection
* AGI: maybe interests won't converge or align
* AGI: existential threat ~
* Currently: sixth great extinction
* Patrick: Quantum Computing? may or may not assist as and when usable
* If AI gets better at designing HW

Is LLM in its infancy? Is this hype? See AVs
* May not be as speedy

Is language prediction sufficient for cognition?
* Unlikely next genius ill be the next AI

Capacity to feel?
* We are embodied creatures. AI: does not >> NPCs, real life actors??
* Conceptual convergence: merge horizons ~
* Students mesmerized by devices
* AI:Needs regulation

Gen AI
* development accelerating
* genuine intelligence

Pofound Risk to Society & Humanity
* Hinton

David: AI: also a boon
* Molecular bio: protein ~ from the letters to 3D folded shape
* Deep Mind: makes breakthrough
* If human would get a Nobel prize
* Many treatments in range

CO2 issues not yet solved
* AI could save planet

Can we harness beneficial while avoiding catastrophe

* Will increase unemployment
* Will change jobs
* Will flood with bad posts

We are in an arms race
* companies: "google" top twenty word in all languages
* Countries: china..

AI survey humanf extinction
* 10% chance in extinction

Runaway change underway needs regulation
* Europe in more control but pace too fast
* Need more nimble aproach

Patrick: will humans adapt?
* Luddite fallacy

Digital Athens ~ most creative because slaves, most luxery
