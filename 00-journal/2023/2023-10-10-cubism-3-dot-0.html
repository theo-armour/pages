<p>Cubism is a revolutionary art movement that emerged in the early 20th century, primarily developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The principles of Cubism include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Geometric Simplification</strong>: Objects and figures in Cubist paintings are broken down into geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Perspectives</strong>: Instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, Cubist artists portrayed the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract Representation</strong>: Cubism often abstracts the forms of the subjects, breaking them down into geometric shapes and reassembling them in a fragmented manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interplay of Light and Plane</strong>: Cubists explored the interplay of light and plane, using shading and color to give depth to flat surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overlap and Transparency</strong>: Objects and backgrounds might overlap, and objects might be transparent, allowing the viewer to see through them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduction to Basic Shapes</strong>: Everything is reduced to basic geometric shapes, eliminating unnecessary details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collage Elements</strong>: Some Cubist works incorporate mixed media and collage elements, blending painting with other materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Color Palette</strong>: Early Cubist paintings often had a restricted color palette, with artists using neutral colors and earth tones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emphasis on Structure</strong>: The structural quality of the object is emphasized over its surroundings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rejection of Traditional Techniques</strong>: Cubists rejected the traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles allowed Cubists to explore objects and figures in an innovative way, breaking them down and viewing them from multiple angles simultaneously. The movement had a profound impact on modern art, influencing many subsequent art movements and artists.</p>

<h3 id="result-2">Result #2</h3>
<p>Cubism is a revolutionary modern art movement that emerged in the early 20th century. Here are some key principles of Cubism:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Perspectives</strong>: One of the most distinctive characteristics of Cubism is the application of multiple perspectives in a single artwork. Instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, Cubist artists showcased multiple facets of the object simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geometric Shapes</strong>: Cubism is known for breaking down objects into geometric shapes like cubes, spheres, and cones. These fragmented forms are then reassembled to create the final composition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flatness of the Picture Plane</strong>: Traditional techniques of perspective and depth were rejected in Cubism. Instead, the style emphasized the flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monochromatic Color Palette</strong>: Early Cubist artworks often employed a restricted color palette, primarily using shades of brown, gray, and green. This helped to focus on the structure and form of the objects rather than their color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong>: As Cubism evolved, the compositions became increasingly abstract, moving further away from representational art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deconstruction and Reassembly</strong>: Objects in Cubist artworks are deconstructed into their basic geometric components and then reassembled in a way that might not be true to their real-world appearance but offers a more conceptual understanding of their essence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles were pioneered by artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque and marked a significant departure from traditional art forms, leading to a broader exploration of abstract art in the 20th century.</p>

<h2 id="basic-points-of-cubism-summarized">Basic points of Cubism Summarized</h2>
<p>Gathering all sixteen items from the two above lists, we have the following basic points of Cubism 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Perspectives (x2)</li>
<li>Monochromatic Color Palette ~ Limited Color Palette</li>
<li>Geometric Simplification ~ Reduction to Basic Shape</li>
<li>Geometric Shapes ~ Emphasis on Structure</li>
<li>Abstract Representation ~ Abstraction</li>
<li>Interplay of Light and Plane ~ Flatness of the Picture Plane</li>
<li>Overlap and Transparency ~ Collage Elements ~ Deconstruction and Reassembly</li>
<li>Rejection of Traditional Techniques</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basic-points-of-cubism-30">Basic points of Cubism 3.0</h3>
<p>If Cubism 3.0 is to be interesting, it must have the ability to turn the above list on its head and inside out. Here is a first attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cubism: Multiple Perspectives (x2) || 3.0: multiple Viewpoints</li>
<li>Cubism: Monochromatic Color Palette ~ Limited Color Palette || 3.0: billions of colors</li>
<li>Cubism: Geometric Simplification ~ Reduction to Basic Shape = reductionism || 3.0: holism</li>
<li>Cubism: Geometric Shapes ~ Emphasis on Structure || 3.0: emphasis on process</li>
<li>Cubism: Abstract Representation ~ Abstraction = Plato || 3.0: concretization or specialization = Aristotle</li>
<li>Cubism: Interplay of Light and Plane ~ Flatness of the Picture Plane || 3.0: Interplay of Darkness and Volume ~ multidimensionality of the picture plane ~ multiple isolations or exclusions</li>
<li>Cubism: Overlap and Transparency ~ Collage Elements ~ Deconstruction and Reassembly || 3.0: &quot;Synthesis and Integration&quot; or &quot;Consolidation and Unification&quot;</li>
<li>Cubism: Rejection of Traditional Techniques || 3.0: Disruption/Remix of Traditional Techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these points and more will be outlined and detailed in future posts. And these, in turn, with your help lead to the Manifesto of Cubism 3.0.</p>

<h2 id="opposite-of-reductionism">opposite of reductionism</h2>
<p>The opposite of reductionism is <strong>holism</strong>¹. Reductionism is the approach that breaks down complex systems into their individual components for understanding, while holism emphasizes understanding the system as a whole¹. Holism posits that the properties of a system cannot be explained solely in terms of its constituent parts and their interactions¹.</p>
<p>There are two forms of antireductionism or holism:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Epistemological antireductionism</strong> holds that we simply are not capable of understanding systems at the level of their most basic constituents, and so the program of reductionism must fail¹.</li>
<li><strong>Ontological antireductionism</strong> holds that such a complete explanation in terms of basic constituents is not possible even in principle for some systems¹.</li>
</ol>
<p>In disciplines such as cybernetics and systems theory, a non-reductionist view of science is embraced, sometimes explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, which is, in a sense, the opposite of a reductionist approach¹.</p>

<h2 id="opposite-of-abstraction">opposite of Abstraction</h2>
<p>The opposite of abstraction is <strong>concretization</strong>⁵ or <strong>specialization</strong>⁵. Abstraction is the process of considering something independently of its associations, attributes, or concrete accompaniments¹. On the other hand, concretization refers to making something concrete, specific, or definite⁵, and specialization refers to focusing on a specific aspect or feature⁵.</p>

<p>The opposite of &quot;Interplay&quot; could be &quot;Isolation&quot; or &quot;Social Exclusion&quot;¹. While &quot;Interplay&quot; refers to the interaction or reciprocal relationship between things, &quot;Isolation&quot; refers to the state of being in a place or situation that is separate from others¹. &quot;Social Exclusion&quot; refers to a state in which individuals are unable to participate fully in economic, social, political and cultural life¹.</p>

<p>The opposite of &quot;Deconstruction and Reassembly&quot; could be considered as &quot;Synthesis and Integration&quot; or &quot;Consolidation and Unification&quot;². While &quot;Deconstruction and Reassembly&quot; involves breaking down a structure into its constituent parts and then putting them back together, &quot;Synthesis and Integration&quot; or &quot;Consolidation and Unification&quot; involves combining separate elements to form a coherent whole².</p>
