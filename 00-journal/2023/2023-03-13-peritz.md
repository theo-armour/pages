China - us global order

contrast - Hass - china  & Us coop is most important - not Ukraine - to maintain civilization

China is a Superpower. US decline

US must figure cooperation  - new cold war

1 - Xi third term

Xi and Biden

2 - anticipated better terms aft trump - not happened

3 - amplified US hostility - spiral of antagonism

C helped in 2007

4 - Balloon - sign of strain

Nuclear not likely - climate change most urgent

if C & US don't agree on climate - then others won't

will be hard - partner + competitor

superpower

no growth until 1980 - regions get market reform with foreigners - massively successful experiment

no other country grows like this - miracle - 95% on less than 1$ day - now 5%

20 cities in China over 10 million -
- massive transform
- was huge until 1700s - then shrinks decimated humiliation - now middle income
- size of economy indicates prestige
- not not show off - priorities all internal - until recently

xi rewrites construction. 3 terms. aftermath of of Mao. M's last decade a disaster.
- adds reforms

enough power to be a new Mao - takes over

party policy dominates - now pivoting

nationalistic, militaristic,expansionist

cannot sustain the growth of selling goods to other countries -low added value goods - but wages grow

selling to own people and higher quality
bursting the housing bubble

changing the perspective

saudi + iran >>> china brokered!! big invest SA Africa

larger middle class - what want? to be recognized - means voting rights - access to political power

party sees this. be careful. how to keep in check

give sense of pride: nationalism.

c19 policy ended - protests - was failure - party decisions could not b challenged

policy misunderstood disease - zero c19 policy - quarantine not not work with highly contagious

huge disruption - negative test before anything - rapid lockdown -

huge complexes locked down because one single case

Sino vaccine efficacy 60% - pfizer 90%  - not enough elderly vaxxed

therefore protests - reservoir of resent - A4 protest

policy ended - millions died - record being erased

***

Taiwan trickiest - will china do same as Hong Kong?

contract Said autonomy - but no longer

taiwan threat to china - similar to Ukraine - democrat and wealthy at same time,

can be blockaded - forced into submission

C in drivers seat - watch Ukraine - must prevail

21st C autocracy - see 1984 - surveillance everywhere ~ AI powered

investing resources - orwellian - eliminate cash currency - use phones as bank account - records created

social credit score - for behavior - dissident get negative rating - all activity watched

good scores get all the benefits ~ exporting to other autocratic regimes

bubble may burst but structurally: aging problem

not enough babies ~ too many old to get benefits ~ not enough workers

C does not like immigration - guest workers only

world economy disintegration - changing economy models ~ no longer want 50 countries to make 1 TV

C personal dictatorship: usual outcome: death Xi is 58

C party - party is leader of all

best to be member of communist party - or know one

92 million members

Politburo standing committee - 7 peeps - Xi controls

some democracy in elections - claims legitimacy- unlike Russia

wants people to support - economic material evidence

allowed channels of protests - pollution & corruption

meritocracy - promote competent - give tests - continue of confucian -

repression & responsive at same time - from our perspective

can't see in - don't know how much resent

don't crit - are diffs -

but we must cooperation - frenemies - for humanities sake

women - in power cp: men

not continue trump
