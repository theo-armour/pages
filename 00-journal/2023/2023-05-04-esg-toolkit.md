# ESG / SDG Toolkit

## Concept

* Develop a toolkit for ESG / SDG
* An "ad" on the Husk & Stone web site or LinkedIn or wherever outlining the toolkit

The message

* The toolkit prepares your organization to get started with ESG / SDG
* Fixed price, fixed time, fixed deliverables
* Your kickstart ESG toolkit: only €1999!!!

## Mission

ESG ~ Environmental, social, and corporate governance

* Get the ball rolling with ESG / SDG in your organization!
* Fast / Easy / Cheap!
* Learn / Help / Prosper

## Vision

The deliverables

* Early adopters in the organization are identified
* Goals, targets, metrics are identified
* Outside collaborators are prepared to come on board

## The Problem

Problem: People want ESG but they don't know how to start or where to go for help.

Solution: Create a package that you can sell to companies that will help the organization get started / take the first steps on ESG.


## Goal of the package

* Several people in the client organization are identified and briefed on the first steps to take
* Three or more outside organizations with ESG credentials and expertise are identified as collaborators
* The two sets of parties have been introduced to each other


## The solution

* A simple, well-defined "package" you can sell to companies
* You do the first few yourself
* Then you teach others how to do it

The package will include:

One week of your time max

* 8 hours to understand the company
* 8 hours to understand the relevant SDGs
* 8 hours to understand the relevant metrics & reporting
* 8 hours day to understand and contact the relevant friends and enemies
* 8 hours to outline business plan for an internal startup dedicated to ESG/SDG

Mission:

* Create the elevator pitch / outline business plan for an internal startup dedicated to ESG/SDG
* identify the relevant SDGs
* Identify the relevant metrics
* Identify the relevant reporting
* Identify the relevant friends and enemies

The customer now has enough data to start looking internally for the right people to staff the internal startup.

Once you have done half a dozen of these, you will be able to teach others how to do it

_the following is a pre,iminary outline of the package_

_It should cover goals, targets and metrics as well as the processes and available tools for arriving at each_

## Compliance

We find experts for your people to talk to
In at least three areas
* local, state and federal government and nonp=prifts with relevant expertise
* Industry associations and other players

* Adhere to Deep Compliance, Auditing, Accountability, Responsibility and Transparency
* Obtain and maintain recognition from bodies that matter:
* SDG, federal, regional, local, economic sector, industry whatever
* Connect with GDR, GSI, get staff involved in their committees
* Fingers crossed: In return:
* you receive numbers that count, numbers that are useful
* Feedback, accolades that are useful
* Team members: receive extra career fulfillment - would not receive internally


## Numbers that count

15. Scoreboard Principle:
Metrics motivate. Quantifying your progress on a task will push you to work harder, as it’ll become like a game in which you’re trying to increase your score. Find ways to number your progress, and you’ll become determined to make the numbers grow.

* Really Useful. Much wanted. Allows accessing to others peoples stats. Enables comparisons
* Goals ~ targets ~ metric: it's all about the numbers
* Ultra Measurable. It must be measurable
* The numbers must be meaningful to the individual - personal data on a timely identifiable basis


## Design / Methodology

_Work in progress_

* There's an app for that.
* Make it so no human data entry.
* All data points are captured digitally, automatically, always
