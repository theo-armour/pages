## I Have Infinite Zero Interest

On the other hand - not that I have one, one may have interest even though one may have zero interest. I have no interest because, after all, I cannot think of any rational purpose of even thinking of getting my aged carcass on one of these devices. ;-)

Nonetheless, I believe the "thought experiment" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment on "Fliteboard" is of interest.

## For Me The word "Future" is unrealistically important

When I talk about "living in the future" ( sometimes referred to as "Theo's dream utopia" ) there some unspoken but specific ideals - see also "[Rules of Road Runner...]( https://kottke.org/12/03/the-rules-of-road-runner-and-wile-e-coyote-cartoons )". The rules may include:

* The idea works as advertised
* The idea is beneficial to one and all
* The idea may cause any bad thing to happen
* Some aspect of security or beauty is infereable
*
In other words the idea is examined in its own ideal and perfect and wonderful world. After all,f the idea cannot be seen to be satisfying in a perfect world then it may be likely to haveaspects that suck in the real world.

## Dreaming of the Possibility of a New Freedoms or Liberties

_So tell me what you want, what you really, really want_

Freedom of speech and pursuit of happines are great.  Not to be forgotten though: the primal animal freedom to move at liberty in 3D. An animal that can move freely is happier than an animal that is stuck.

Happiness happens so often in modern life that we most often let the moment pass by without registering it. OK, this is debateable, but bear with me. Moments of happiness that are readily attainable may include a physicality - dancing, playing tennis, practicing making babies, whatever.

In recent times we have enlarged the range of available 3D physicality. Gymnasts, figure skaters perform moves impossible to previous generations. When you include new technology, human physicality attains new freedoms. Skis & snowboards, goggles & flippers, mountain bikes & skateboards enable movement in 3D space that eviscerate gravity.

What about Fliteboard?

## Wave to the Beauty

My simple vision is of a body on one of these devices is slithering hips, undulating shoulders and twisting torso in such a way to rule the waves by waiving the rules.

Have you skied through deep powder down a mountain slope? Have you felt your body engaging yet freeing itself from the terrain beneath? If so, how might you feel about surfing up a five meter wave?
