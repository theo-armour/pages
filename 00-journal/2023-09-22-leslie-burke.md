Hi Leslie

Thank you for your good reply.

I hope you don't mind me continuing the dialog regarding older drivers just a bit more.

I should point out that my mother was killed at 61 in a car accident driven by an older person. My parents-in-law were killed at 81 and 79 in a car crash. So, I guess I am quite sensitive to the issue of older drivers.

In order to learn about the issue, I asked ChatGPT to write a few paragraphs about older drivers. My prompt is: "I am a resident of a retirement community. I am concerned about an 89-rear old fellow resident who owns and drives a car." Here is a link to ChatGPT's response:

I agree with most everything - particularly for the idea for transitioning from a life of driving to one without a motor vehicle.

A couple further points:

On more then one occasion I remember Bernie saying that he was very concerned about the declining driving capabilities his sister and brother-in-law. So he is familiar with the issue.

A big lesson I am learning by living at HotM is that almost all residents compare their current capabilities with their capabilities 10 or 20 years ago. They are not comparing their current capabilities with the capabilities of other residents. So, they are not aware of their own decline.

The result is that they do very little planning for the future. They are not aware of the need to transition from a life of driving to one without a motor vehicle.

Thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you. I hope you didn't mind me continuing the dialog. ;-)

Hello Leslie,

Firstly, I appreciate your response. I'd like to continue our discussion on older drivers, given its personal significance to me. My mother was tragically killed in a car accident involving an older driver, and my parents-in-law also met a similar fate. This has made me particularly sensitive to the issue.

I sought ChatGPT's insights on the topic, prompted by my concerns about an 89-year-old resident who still drives. You can find the response here. I largely agree with the content, especially the emphasis on transitioning away from driving, I also wanted to share some additional observations:

https://chat.openai.com/share/46ff2b27-dc1b-46e9-911c-cfe7567fa8c8

1. Bernie has expressed concerns about the declining driving abilities of his relatives, indicating he's aware of the potential risks.

2. I am mostly concerned about lengthy night drives on highways, which are particularly dangerous for older drivers. The return trip from Stanford Women's Basketball games is a good example.

3. At HotM, I've noticed that many residents compare their current abilities to their past, often overlooking their own decline. This lack of self-awareness can hinder proactive planning for the future, such as preparing for a life without driving.

I hope our open dialogues like this can raise awareness and encourage better planning. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts, and I look forward to your feedback.

Warm regards,

Theo
