Today today we celebrate the beginning of the Centenary of the Julia Morgan building. I've done a lot help this project

Bringing up 170th anniversary of the San Francisco ladies protection Relief Society I sent into motion to Celebration of the Centenary of this building.

Patti also would have remembered but would she have said anything without my support. Who knows? Anyway me being a big fan helped the get a life.

I helped breathe life into the idea that this could be a fundraiser

I attended every meeting and prepared notes of my activities accomplished and projected

I drafted and published two Wikipedia entries for the Society and for the Julia Morgan Building.Third HotM article on the way.

In doing so I secured the name of "Julie Morgan Building and Wikipedia 

I requested and obtained and paid for copies of the drawings held by Bancroft Library downloaded them and made them available to Heritage staff. I also put them on GitHub

I drafted the text for the historic designation Landmark plaque. The text was approved by all parties.

I followed up on and progressed the contract to get a plaque manufactured. And I paid for it

Given that the plaque wouldn't be available in time I use the artwork to get quotes and paid for aluminum replicas to be made and I bargained a wonderful deal - eight for $500.

I use my drone to take photographs of the building and the many roses. 

I create an extensive collection of photos of the building that have been shared and used in a variety of ways

I wrote a lengthy papers "The Roses of 3400 Laguna" and "???" and made available to the planners and others

I wrote a lengthy paper with photos of each of the representations of roses that I discovered I made that paper available to many people

I supplied images to be used in the cookies to be made by Dining Services.

I use the photos in many articles in Heritage Happenings 

I had lunch with Woody LaBounty of San Francisco Heritage and made available the paper and written on the Roses

Through my efforts Woody wrote a nice article about the building
I captured that article and turned it into a PDF reprint that could be printed and given out as a handout

I gave a tour of the building to the Next Village. And will do more in the future

I took all the materials from the Board of Supervisors Proclamation and turned it paper and an email that can be reprinted circulated to all

I turned the 2-hour for the supervisors video into just a clip of "us" that could be shared

I Initiated a project to obtain a scanner and scan all historical documents held in the library. These will be used to improve thee wikipedia articles and future monographs

I project managed getting Til's models down to the exhibition Hall

Upon advice from ?, I requested a photographer and Mary made that happen

I set up the projector with the slideshow on the ceiling in the park for the centenary celebration

I set up and prepared a video camera to capture the talk

Before and after the talks I was at tour guide outside
