There are books that are a thousand years old. This leads to the argument that paper is a better preserver of information than digital methods. I would argue that paper does not have as goods prospect of lengthy survival than digital methods.

The magic is not the paper. The magic is the copying.

The book that was a thousand years old was probably a bible. If so then the text in the bible had been copied from an older text - a process going back thousands of years. And the text may be the same as the Bible that was printed yesterday.

Ship of Theseus retort ~ your DNA is billions of years old ~ consider the DNA of all the other creatures ~ it's not the individual atoms that count; it's the way they are joined to together ~ the protocol is more important than the fact ~ the replication ~ recombination of matter is more important than the matter itself.
