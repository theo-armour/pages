# 2023-07-25 Fashionable Problems

2023-07-25 Copied from my email to Cynthia

My premise was that the topics and quantity of scientific papers and legislaive efforts are as much followers of media trends and fashions as anybody else.

A corollary is that the time for the underlying topic of the trend to come into fruition has very little to do with the meteoric rise and fasll of a media trend
