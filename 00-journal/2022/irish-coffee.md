# Notes Old


>> Irish Coffee was created in the winter of 1943 by Joe Sheridan, chef at Foynes Port near Limerick, Ireland

Chef Joe is from good Old Limerick
But on his job he's so derelict
He plies us with coffee
That makes us quite naughty
While We just think it's Joe's party trick!

He's ever so naughty
