## Fashionable technology

We don't often think of technology as being fashionable. The term implies a popularity engineered by industry as which is trending. Things that are considered fashionable are available and popularized by a "fashion" system - industry, influencers and media.

A primary factor of fashion is trending. Popularity waxes and wanes. Item is in the spotlight and then it fades away - to br replaced by the next item in the spotlight.

Bard reports:

Here are some examples of technology trends that have been in the media spotlight for a while and then faded:

* Virtual reality (VR): VR was a hot topic in the media a few years ago, but the hype has since died down. This is likely because VR headsets are still relatively expensive and there are not many major VR applications available.
* Self-driving cars: Self-driving cars have been a topic of discussion in the media for many years, but they are still not widely available. This is likely due to the fact that self-driving cars are still in the early stages of development and there are many legal and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed.
* The metaverse: The metaverse is a term that has been used to describe a virtual world that is accessed through VR or AR headsets. The metaverse has been a hot topic in the media recently, but it is still unclear what it will actually look like or how it will be used.

It is important to remember that technology trends come and go. Some trends will fade away, while others will become more important in the future. It is also important to note that the media coverage of technology trends is not always a good indication of their actual importance.

AI is currently very fashionable. It is in the media spotlight. It is being popularized by industry, influencers and media. It is being hyped.

Example:

"Raoul Pal says AI could become the 'biggest bubble of all time'": Morning Brief
* https://news.yahoo.com/raoul-pal-says-ai-could-become-the-biggest-bubble-of-all-time-morning-brief-103046757.html

And very likely - just like many of its predecessors: AI is being over-hyped by the media, industry and influencers and will fade away.

See Google Trends for selver driving cars, CR and thre metaverse:

Currently AI is front page material all over.

This is not to say that these technologies are not important. They are. But they are not as likely to come into fruition as speedily as the media would have us believe.

## Are we there yet?

Inventions that changed the world include

* fire
* wheel
* cloth
* plow
* sailboat
* compass
* printing press
* clock
* gunpowder
* steam engine
* telegraph
* telephone
* light bulb
* internal combustion engine
* airplane
* computer
* transistor
* mobile phone
* internet

All took years to decades to become mainstream

Why should AI be any different?

There are so aspects of AI that seem to match previous advances, I can only suggest that the transformation will be as great as the internet and other great inventions. And AI will take just as long to be fully implemented as the predecessors.

## AI is a tool

Here are some  useful things

* Electric lights
* Air conditioners
* Mobile phones

AI will be useful in a similar way.


## Your new best friend

AI will become:

* Your new best friend
* Your mini-me ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Me
* Alter ego ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego

Your new best friend will become best friends with your significant other's new best friend.

## AI session

* It is a good listener
* It is good at improv
* It follows Tina Fey's four rules of improv:

>1. You must agree
>2. “Yes” isn’t enough, you must “yes, and…”
>3. Make statements.
>4. There are no mistakes!

### With AI, there are no mistake

* There are no mistakes, only happy accidents
* Everything is good-looking - even if it's wrong

Just as I have difficulty re-imagining the world without the internet, I will have difficulty re-imagining a world without AI.
