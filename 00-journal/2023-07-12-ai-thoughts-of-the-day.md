## Fashion

What is a fashion or a trend?

We don't often think of technology as being "fashionable". The term implies a rise and fall in popularity engineered by an industry that seeks such events. Things that are considered fashionable are available and popularized by a "fashion" system - industry, influencers and media.

A primary factor of fashion is trending - a coming and a going. Popularity waxes and wanes. Item is in the spotlight and then it fades away - only to be replaced by the next item in the spotlight.

## Fashionable Technology

Bard reports:

Here are some examples of technology trends that have been in the media spotlight for a while and then faded:

* Virtual reality (VR): VR was a hot topic in the media a few years ago, but the hype has since died down. This is likely because VR headsets are still relatively expensive and there are not many major VR applications available.
* Self-driving cars: Self-driving cars have been a topic of discussion in the media for many years, but they are still not widely available. This is likely due to the fact that self-driving cars are still in the early stages of development and there are many legal and regulatory challenges that need to be addressed.
* The metaverse: The metaverse is a term that has been used to describe a virtual world that is accessed through VR or AR headsets. The metaverse has been a hot topic in the media recently, but it is still unclear what it will actually look like or how it will be used.

It is important to remember that technology trends come and go. Some trends will fade away, while others will become more important in the future. It is also important to note that the media coverage of technology trends is not always a good indication of their actual importance.

AI is currently very fashionable. It is in the media spotlight. It is being popularized by industry, influencers and media. It is being hyped.

Example:

"Raoul Pal says AI could become the 'biggest bubble of all time'": Morning Brief

## Over hype

Skirt lengths and sideburns go up and down. Movies and music are popular and then fade away. The same is true of technology except that from time to time the cycle is exaggerated. The importance of the technology is over-hyped. The media, industry and influencers are all in on the hype. The hype is self-reinforcing. The hype is a bubble.

The media indicates that the new technology is changing our lives now, drastically and ubiquitously.

The technology mme of the moment may well do so - eventually. But it is not doing so now. And it is not likely to do so in the near future.

## AI is over-hyped

Very likely - just like many of its predecessors: AI is being over-hyped by the media.

See Google Trends for self driving cars, virtual reality and the metaverse:

Note the rise and fall of interest in these technologies.
Currently AI is front page material all over.

Another aspect is that the over-hype spills over into other areas. For example, the number of laws and lawsuits is likely to increase and then decrease along with the number of scientific papers.

## Conclusion

At this stage it is not possible to decide the amount of over-hype being given to AI. Nonetheless you can be quite certain that the media wil move in to other topics eventually. And the AI stories will be replaced by the next big thing.


## Are we there yet?

This is not to say that these technologies are not important. They are. But they are not as likely to come into fruition as speedily as the media would have us believe.

Inventions that changed the world include:

* fire
* wheel
* cloth
* plow
* sailboat
* compass
* printing press
* clock
* gunpowder
* steam engine
* telegraph
* telephone
* light bulb
* internal combustion engine
* airplane
* computer
* transistor
* mobile phone
* internet

All took years to decades to become mainstream

Why should AI be any different?

There are so aspects of AI that seem to match previous advances, I can only suggest that the transformation will be as great as the internet and other great inventions. And AI will take just as long to be fully implemented as the predecessors.

## What's next

What is the next big thing? Who knows. We had no clue about the Intern and mobile phones. Something will come along after AI and it will be just as big. And just as beyond our imagination.


## AI is a tool

Here are some  useful things

* Electric lights
* Air conditioners
* Mobile phones
* Scissors

AI will be useful in a similar way.


## Your new best friend

AI will become:

* Your new best friend
* Your mini-me ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Me
* Alter ego ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego

Your new best friend will become best friends with your significant other's new best friend.

## AI session

* It is a good listener
* It is good at improv
* It follows Tina Fey's four rules of improv:

>1. You must agree
>2. “Yes” isn’t enough, you must “yes, and…”
>3. Make statements.
>4. There are no mistakes!

### With AI, there are no mistake

* There are no mistakes, only happy accidents
* Everything is good-looking - even if it's wrong

Just as I have difficulty re-imagining the world without the internet, I will have difficulty re-imagining a world without AI.
