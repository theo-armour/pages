# King Charles III Coronation

I got up at 3 am and watched for a couple of hours. ðŸ˜‰

An observation: Seriously Modern Technology was used!

* No visible cameras, mikes, cables or technology visible anywhere in the Abbey
* Camera peeps replaced by dozens of tiny hidden cameras and mikes, and masses of bandwidth
* A person from the 18th century might not have noticed any of the technology

Mostly unanswerable techie questions:

* What portion of the cameras were pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ)? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%E2%80%93tilt%E2%80%93zoom_camera
* What portion of the cameras were skycams? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skycam
* What portion of the cameras were 4K? 8K? 12K?
* What portion of the cameras were HDR?
* What portion of what we saw was orchestrated by humans and what portions were orchestrated by digitally controlled switches?
* It all went like clockwork; the amount of rehearsal must have been enormous: how do you program manage a one-off process like that?


## The Coronation

Questions

* How tricky is it to place a crown of 2.2kg on a person's head when the crown is worth Â£3.5 billion?


What I viewed

* Mostly images of young people wearing unusual clothes and singing in high-pitched voices
* People frequently changing position from standing to sitting to kneeling and back again
* A lot of papers and gold objects being carried around
* A lot of people walking around in unusual clothes
* People saying weird things
* It was a made-for-TV event
* Most everybody in the Abbey saw almost nothing of the proceedings; while TV viewers saw everything

What I observed

* Most everybody was white
* There was much tokenism ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism
* It was raining outside
* It all went like clockwork; the amount of rehearsal must have been enormous

What I feel

* It was not very exciting
* The sermon was nearly unintelligible it was so laden with unexplained references
* The putting on of the crown was the most exciting part - and that was not very exciting
* The musical experience was mostly not that interesting
  * The pieces were safe; the sound quality was not that good (compared to a concert)
* Visually, the ceremony was sumptuous
* It felt like an AI-generated "hallucination"
* Fun to look at but no deep takeaways
* I was slightly moved by the event
* It was all ritual and ceremony; almost no smiles or liveness
* Similar to a funeral, wedding or graduation; once in a lifetime events
* Memorable but not game-changing
