The other evening Stephan Breuer shared with me by email a number of images of his projects. I was more than intrigued. I was confronted by the realities of modern design.

I have bee involved with Computer Aided Design (CAD) for over fifty years. A CAD model is a digital representation of a physical object. The digiteal representation is a collection of points, lines, curves and surfaces. The lines are prefectly straight, the curves ae perfectly smooth and the surfaces are perfectly flat. The digital model is a perfect representation of the design.

In a sense the digital model is representation the Plato's concept of the existence of the "Forms" or "Ideas," which are perfect, eternal, and immutable archetypes of the things we see in the world. For example, there is a perfect "Form" of a chair in the realm of Forms, and all chairs in the physical world are imperfect copies of this Form.

The image Stephan sent of the plan of his project at the Palais Royal typifies this idea of the perfect digital model. The lines are perfectly straight, the curves are perfectly smooth and the surfaces are perfectly flat.

The actual Palais Royal is, of course, a normal old building full of wear and tear and imperfections.

For decades it has always been this way. The digital model is perfect. The physical model is imperfect. And this is the way Plato would have it.

Further down Stephan included this image.

It was the Lidar scan of an interior space. A lidar scan is merely a collection of thousands of points in space. The points are not connected by lines or curves. The points are not connected to form surfaces. The points are just points.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar

A human can look at the points and can surmise that the points indicated a space, but that "knowledge" is not inherent in the points themselves.

In this sense the space reflects an the point of view of Aristotle. Aristotle rejected Plato's theory of Forms. Instead, he believed that the essence of an object is found in the object itself, not in a separate realm of Forms. For Aristotle, the form of an object is its actual structure or organization.

Lidar has been around for decades. It is only recently that the technology has become affordable and the software has become available to make use of the data. Theese days there is software that can now connect the points to form lines, curves and surfaces. The software can now create a digital model that is a perfect representation of the physical object.

But seeing the two types of representation side by side woke me up. We now can chooserto represent the world in the way that suits us best. You can be Platonic. You can be Aristotelian. You can be both.

The fuzzy Lidar data introduces new ways of thinking about our efforts. With Plate, we deduce  starting with general principles (like the Forms) and deducing specific implications from them.

But now with Aristotle's view. We can be more inductive, starting with specific observations and moving to general principles.

Perhaps we are bring back some of the aspects of drawing our buildings by hand.

But much more fun, we are adding the idea of the Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss's bricolear

The traditional CAD operator is the ingenieur. Thje Lidar jockey is the bricoleur.

There may eveb be ocerlaps with the Cathedral and the Bazaar

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar.

In the cathedral things are done in a top-down manner. In the bazaar things are done in a bottom-up manner. both systems work.

With Stephan's collection of images, I sensed for the first time that we are entering a new era of design. We can be more Aristotelian. We can be more bricoleur. We can be more bazaar.

The lidar scans of points will become part of our design process. We will use to inform our designs.

The reality that we live in an imperfect world is may now be reflected in our digital models. The digital models need no longer to be perfect. They are now imperfect. They are now more like the physical world. What does this mean for our designs?

Our Platonic world will coexist wioth our Arioistotelian world.

Our as-built models will co-exist with our as-designed models - which in turn will co-exist with the real buildings.

I have no idea where this is going. But I am excited to be along for the ride.
